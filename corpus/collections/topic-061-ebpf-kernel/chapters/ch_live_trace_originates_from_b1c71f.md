The foundational unit of traceability in this architecture is the identifier, a stable key that anchors every record across fact and dimension tables alike. In the traceability layer, identifiers such as `FROM-0001` through `FROM-0004` serve as the primary linkage between operational measurements and their provenance. Each identifier maps to an `originates_from` reference, which in turn resolves through a dimension table to a human-readable label and a categorical classification. For instance, the identifier `FROM-0001` carries the label `Originates From Label 01` and falls under `Originates From Category 01`, while `FROM-0002` resolves to `Originates From Label 02` within `Originates From Category 02`. This two-level indirection—identifier to originates_from key to category—ensures that provenance metadata remains decoupled from transactional data, permitting category reclassification without altering the underlying fact records. The `category` field thus functions as a coarse-grained organizational axis, grouping trace entries by their source lineage rather than by any operational characteristic.

Attributes and their types constitute the second structural pillar, implemented through a normalized attribute-value pattern that separates schema definition from data storage. The `attr` column stores the name of a property—`confidence`, `dimension_kind`, `method`, `recorded_at` in one context, and `checksum`, `created_date`, `identifier`, `license` in another—while the `attr_type` column declares its semantic type using a namespace-qualified schema, such as `xsd:decimal`, `xsd:string`, `xsd:dateTime`, `xsd:date`, or `cco:DesignativeICE`. This type declaration is not merely documentation; it governs which value table receives the actual data. Decimal-valued attributes like `confidence` (with observed values of `0.002` and `0.018`) are persisted in the decimal value table, string-valued attributes such as `dimension_kind` (holding `Dimension Kind 01`) and `encoding` (holding `Encoding 02`) reside in the varchar value table, and temporal attributes like `recorded_at` carry ISO 8601 timestamps including `2025-06-10T14:56:29` and `2024-06-25T12:59:02`. The `misc` column in each value table is the generic storage vessel for these heterogeneous values, its name reflecting the fact that it holds data of varying semantic content unified only by their shared entity and attribute references.

The `entity` column is the linchpin of this value-resolution mechanism, appearing as a foreign key in every value table and pointing back to the primary identifier of the record to which the attribute belongs. An entity such as `ASSI-0001` may simultaneously own a decimal attribute value of `0.002` under attribute `ASSI-0001`, a string attribute value of `Dimension Kind 01` under attribute `ASSI-0002`, and a datetime value of `2025-06-10T14:56:29` under attribute `ASSI-0004`, with each value residing in a different typed value table. This multi-table value storage avoids the pitfalls of wide, sparse tables while preserving type safety at query time. The same pattern recurs for kernel hook records: entity `KERN-0001` carries a string value `a3f9c21e` under attribute `KERN-0001`, a date value `2023-02-05` under attribute `KERN-0002`, and integer values `323` and `12` under attributes `KERN-0006` and `KERN-0008` respectively, with the integer values stored in the dedicated integer value table and the string value in the varchar table.

Operational telemetry is captured in the fact table through three complementary metrics: `duration_seconds`, `exit`, and `retry_count`. These columns record the elapsed time of a traced operation, its termination status code, and the number of retry attempts before final resolution. A single trace entry identified as `FROM-0001` exhibits a duration of `1874.27` seconds, an exit code of `491`, and `399` retries, while its peer `FROM-0004` shows a longer duration of `3336.66` seconds but fewer retries at `459`, suggesting that retry frequency and execution time are not linearly correlated. The exit codes—`491`, `900`, `420`, and `60`—span a wide range, indicating that the trace system captures both successful completions and various failure modes within a single schema. Together, these three columns form a minimal but sufficient triad for post-hoc analysis of system reliability, where duration_seconds measures cost, exit measures outcome, and retry_count measures resilience.
