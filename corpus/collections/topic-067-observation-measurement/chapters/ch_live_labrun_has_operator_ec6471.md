The laboratory execution framework distinguishes between the operator that performs a run and the operator entity itself, a separation enforced through the fact table and its associated dimension. The fact table records each laboratory run with a unique identifier such as OPER-0001 through OPER-0004, a reference to the operator via the operator_key column, and three operational metrics: duration_seconds, exit_code, and retry_count. Duration values span from 4308.22 seconds to 5155.73 seconds, exit codes range from 3 to 691, and retry counts are notably high—265, 244, 106, and 12 respectively—suggesting that run failures and re-executions are common in this environment. The operator_key column serves as a foreign key into the dimension table, which supplies the operator_label and operator_category attributes. Labels read as Operator Label 01 through Operator Label 04, while categories follow the same ordinal pattern, providing a stable classification layer that the fact table references without duplicating descriptive content.

Beyond the operator dimension, the system employs an entity-attribute-value model to store heterogeneous metadata about laboratory runs, samples, and observation sites. The attribute definition tables—t_labrun_min_one_sample_attr and t_labrun_observed_at_site_attr—declare the schema for extensible properties, each row specifying an attr_name and its corresponding attr_type. The attribute names are consistent across both contexts: duration_seconds, end_time, exit_code, and host_name. The attr_type column encodes XML Schema datatypes—xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:integer, and xsd:string—ensuring that downstream consumers can interpret stored values without schema discovery. This dual-table approach separates the definition of what attributes exist from the storage of their values, a design choice that supports schema evolution without structural migration.

The value storage layer is partitioned by data type into four parallel tables for each entity context: val_datetime, val_decimal, val_int, and val_varchar. Each table carries entity_id and attr_id as foreign keys, linking a specific attribute instance to its typed value. Decimal values such as 2021.10, 4946.17, 5150.87, and 3275.26 reside in the decimal table, while integer values like 230, 435, 670, and 129 occupy the integer table. Datetime values follow ISO 8601 format—2024-08-01T16:02:07, 2024-02-12T19:03:44, 2023-01-19T08:28:14—and string values include identifiers such as edge-03, closeout, complete, and failed. The misc column, which holds these values, is a generic container whose semantics are entirely determined by the attr_type declared in the definition table. This type-dispatched storage pattern avoids NULL proliferation and enforces value integrity at the row level.

The entity concept unifies these value tables. An entity_id such as SAMP-0001 or SITE-0001 identifies a specific sample or site observation, and the same identifier appears across all four value tables to represent different attributes of that entity. For instance, SAMP-0001 has a decimal value of 2021.10, an integer value of 230, a datetime value of 2024-08-01T16:02:07, and string values including edge-03 and Log Level 02, all linked through the same entity identifier but distributed across type-specific tables. The attr_id column further disambiguates which attribute each value belongs to, with values like SAMP-0001, SAMP-0002, SAMP-0003, and SAMP-0007 referencing specific attribute definitions. This structure allows a single entity to carry an arbitrary number of typed attributes without requiring schema changes.

The labrun column in the sample and site tables provides the operational context for these entities. Sample records reference labruns such as SEQ-EXP-99, PROTOCOL-V3, CEL-SEQR-112, and CEL-SEQR-112, while site records reference PCR-ALPHA, RUN-2023-A4, WET-LAB-44, and PLATE-A12. The occurs_in column in the site table maps each labrun to a physical location—FIELD-STATION-9, CLEAN-ROOM-A, SECURE-VAULT-3, BUILDING-C—creating a traceable chain from abstract protocol to concrete execution environment. Duration values at the site level, such as 3858.44, 2622.63, 5434.21, and 3308.67 seconds, parallel the duration_seconds metric in the operator fact table, enabling cross-context comparison of run performance. Exit codes and retry counts, while stored in the operator fact table, are also declared as attributes in the definition tables, indicating that exit behavior is tracked both as a structured metric and as extensible metadata.
