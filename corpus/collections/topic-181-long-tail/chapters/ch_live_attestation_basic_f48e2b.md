Attestation and descriptive records in a governed compliance corpus are not flat documents; they are typed, referentially bound objects whose meaning depends on a small set of recurring semantic roles. An identifier supplies the durable handle by which every downstream assertion, measurement, and relationship is anchored: attestations such as ATTE-0001 through ATTE-0004 denote distinct compliance events—a vendor risk assessment, HIPAA compliance reviews, an ML model fairness audit—while parallel identifier namespaces govern policy enforcement (ENFO-0001 through ENFO-0006) and non-retracted descriptive artefacts (RETR-0001 through RETR-0004). Without stable identifiers, cross-table joins, audit replay, and amendment control cannot be guaranteed; the identifier is therefore the primary key of traceability, not merely a surrogate column.

Attributes declare what may be said about an entity, and attribute type constrains how it may be said. In the attestation domain, duration_seconds is typed as xsd:decimal, end_time as xsd:dateTime, exit_code as xsd:integer, and host_name as xsd:string; descriptive records carry a parallel vocabulary—confidence as xsd:decimal, dimension_kind and method as xsd:string, recorded_at as xsd:dateTime. Separation of attr from attr_type enforces schema discipline: the name identifies the semantic slot, while the XSD binding routes persistence to the correct value store and validates interchange. A control framework that conflates name and type invites silent corruption—storing 7132.97 beside ingest-21 in the same untyped column—whereas typed attribute catalogues make miscellany governable.

The entity is the subject of description: the business object whose properties are materialised through entity_id references in value tables. ATTE-0001 may simultaneously carry a decimal duration of 7132.97, integer exit codes of 898 and 487, varchar tokens including ingest-21 and initiation, and datetime stamps such as 2024-11-18T12:26:52 and 2023-12-15T15:31:35, each tuple keyed by entity_id and attr_id. The same pattern holds for RETR-0001, where confidence 0.736, dimension_kind “Dimension Kind 01”, and recorded_at 2024-02-12T07:34:36 cohabit one descriptive entity without collapsing into a single wide row. Entity-centric modelling permits heterogeneous, extensible metadata without schema migration for every new control signal.

Misc—here realised as the value field—holds the instantiated fact once entity and attr are resolved. It is deliberately miscellaneous only at the storage boundary: at retrieval, xsd:decimal values such as 6429.54 and 3894.03, integers 71 and 180, strings superseded and es, and datetimes 2023-09-08T13:00:56 partition into type-safe relations. Operational practice routes writes through the attr catalogue so that a misc entry cannot attach to the wrong physical table; reads rehydrate typed literals for reporting, SLA measurement, and evidentiary export. Where multiple values attach to one entity—as when ATTE-0001 records four varchar misc entries across distinct attr_ids—the model preserves cardinality and provenance rather than overwriting prior assertions.

Relational governance extends the entity–attribute pattern with explicit subject, target, and role semantics. Policy enforcement pairs a subject policy (ISO27001 Encryption as ENFO-0001, CCPA Data Deletion as ENFO-0002) with a target enforcer (Splunk SIEM, ISO Audit Board, AWS Config Rules) through junction records that name the role each party plays: observer for ENFO-0001 observed by ENFO-0003, observer again for ENFO-0002 linked to ENFO-0006, reviewer and owner where FINRA Record Retention and PCI-DSS Tokenization delegate to ENFO-0001. Role is not decorative; it fixes accountability—whether a control is watched, assessed, or owned—and prevents symmetric edges from being misread as interchangeable. Subject and target therefore orient directed obligations: the policy is the governed object, the enforcer is the operational instrument, and role qualifies the legal and operational force of the link.

Taken together, identifier, attr, attr_type, entity, misc, subject, target, and role form a layered evidence grammar suitable for attestation workloads, descriptive retention, and enforced policy matrices. Identifiers stabilise identity; attrs and attr_types stabilise meaning; entities group facts; misc carries the measured or asserted state; subject–target–role triples express directed responsibility among controls and their instruments. Implementations that honour this separation—value tables partitioned by XSD type, attribute registries versioned independently of entities, enforcement edges typed by role—support reproducible audits across HIPAA reviews, fairness audits, sensor drift notes, and FINRA retention controls without sacrificing the density of operational detail the corpus demands.
