An audit evidence record is anchored by a unique identifier—AUDI-0001, AUDI-0002, AUDI-0003, AUDI-0004—that serves as the immutable key for every subsequent attribute-value association. Each identifier maps to a human-readable evidence descriptor such as AuditTrail_20231015, ChainOfCustody_Batch44, or SignatureBlock_99A1, establishing the provenance of the observation. The attribute layer then decomposes each evidence item into named properties: confidence, dimension_kind, method, recorded_at, and additional attributes whose names follow the same convention. Every attribute carries a declared type—xsd:decimal, xsd:string, xsd:dateTime, xsd:boolean, xsd:date, or xsd:integer—that constrains the shape of the value stored against it. This type discipline ensures that a confidence score of 0.978 is never conflated with a timestamp such as 2024-10-15T21:07:57, nor with a categorical label like Dimension Kind 01 or Encoding 02.

The value layer is materialized through a family of typed value tables, each dedicated to a single attribute type. Decimal values such as 0.978, 590.71, and 212.01 reside in the decimal store; datetime values such as 2024-11-22T11:38:19 and 2023-06-03T22:32:06 in the datetime store; and string values including intake form, fr, ja, and Encoding 01 in the varchar store. Boolean flags—false, true—occupy their own table, while integer priorities such as 4, 326, 1, and 210 are stored separately. Each value row binds an entity identifier to an attribute identifier, thereby resolving the question of which evidence item or policy record owns which property. The entity, in this architecture, is the record being attributed: it may be an audit evidence item identified by AUDI-0001, or a policy-with-jurisdiction record identified by JURI-0001, JURI-0002, JURI-0003, or JURI-0004.

Policy-with-jurisdiction records extend the same pattern. A policy such as Financial Conduct Authority, European Union, or FISMA is linked to a jurisdiction reference—AUDI-0006, AUDI-0003, AUDI-0001, AUDI-0002—creating a cross-reference between the policy domain and the audit evidence domain. Attributes on these records include effective_date (with values 2023-11-22, 2024-05-18, 2025-06-18, 2023-05-18), enforcement (Enforcement 02), mandatory (true or false), and priority (integers 4, 326, 1, 210). The same type-dispatched value tables apply: dates land in the date store, booleans in the boolean store, integers in the integer store, and strings in the varchar store. This uniformity means that querying for all mandatory policies requires only a single predicate on the boolean value table, regardless of whether the underlying entity is an audit evidence item or a policy record.

The profile-to-null-rate relationship introduces a role-based association between a subject and a target. A profile—QualityGateConfig, ObservationProtocolAlpha, SensorTelemetryV2—is linked to a null rate—dropRate, absentMetric, missingBaseline—through a junction table that carries a role attribute. The role values owner, contributor, and reviewer specify the nature of the association: RATE-0003 holds the owner role with respect to RATE-0005, RATE-0007 and RATE-0004 both hold the contributor role with respect to RATE-0002 and RATE-0001 respectively, and RATE-0004 additionally holds the reviewer role with respect to RATE-0006. Here, the subject is the profile, the target is the null rate, and the role is the semantic predicate that qualifies the link. This triad—subject, target, role—generalizes the entity-attribute-value pattern by making the relationship itself a first-class, typed, and queryable construct rather than an implicit join.
