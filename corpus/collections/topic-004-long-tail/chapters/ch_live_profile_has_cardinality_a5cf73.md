Observation attributes form the backbone of structured event documentation, where each attribute carries a name and a typed value that constrains how data is stored and interpreted. An attribute such as `duration_seconds` is declared as `xsd:decimal`, meaning its associated measurements—like 1684.40 or 6255.67—are stored in a dedicated decimal value table, while `exit_code` carries the `xsd:integer` type and holds whole-number values such as 701 or 291. Temporal attributes like `end_time` use `xsd:dateTime` and record precise moments such as `2023-06-01T02:07:24`, and string-typed attributes like `host_name` store free-form identifiers such as `node-a01`. This type-aware decomposition ensures that each attribute's values are stored in the appropriate typed store, preserving semantic integrity and enabling type-safe queries across heterogeneous data.

The relationship between observations is captured through precedence records that assert one event precedes another, such as `server_disk_full` preceding `firmware_update_init` or `packet_drop_event` preceding `power_stabilization`. Each precedence relationship is identified by a unique key like `OTHE-0001` and enriched with attribute values drawn from the typed stores. The entity concept ties these pieces together: a single entity such as `OTHE-0001` can carry multiple attributes simultaneously—its duration of 1684.40 seconds, its end time of `2023-06-01T02:07:24`, its exit code of 701, and its host name of `node-a01`—forming a cohesive observation record that can be referenced across the precedence graph.

Cardinality and state represent two distinct measurement domains, each tracked through a fact table that records a numeric value alongside a confidence score and an uncertainty bound. In the cardinality domain, identifiers such as `CARD-0001` through `CARD-0004` anchor individual measurements, each linked to a cardinality key that resolves to a label and a category in a dimension table. A cardinality measurement might report a value of 728.94 with a confidence of 0.994 and an uncertainty of 557.92, while another might show a value of 448.09 with confidence of only 0.226 and uncertainty of 488.10. The wide spread in confidence—ranging from 0.226 to 0.994—signals that not all cardinality readings carry equal reliability, and the uncertainty values, which range from 284.36 to 622.09, quantify the margin of error around each measurement.

The state domain mirrors this structure but operates over a different set of identifiers, `BLOC-0001` through `BLOC-0004`, and is enriched by a two-level categorization scheme. Each state fact records a value, a confidence, and an uncertainty, and is linked to a state key that resolves to a state label and a state category in the dimension table. State measurements show notably lower confidence than cardinality measurements—values as low as 0.012 and 0.075 appear alongside higher readings of 0.523—suggesting that state assessments are inherently more uncertain. The uncertainty bounds in this domain are correspondingly larger, reaching up to 951.90, and the state dimension further nests a category identifier that points to a separate category table, enabling hierarchical classification of states beyond a flat label.

Confidence and uncertainty serve as complementary quality signals across both domains. Confidence is a normalized score between 0 and 1 that expresses how certain the system is about a given measurement, while uncertainty is an absolute bound that quantifies the potential deviation from the reported value. A cardinality reading with confidence 0.994 and uncertainty 557.92 may seem contradictory at first, but the two metrics capture different aspects of reliability: the confidence reflects the model's internal certainty about the measurement process, while the uncertainty reflects the magnitude of possible error in the reported value. Together, they enable downstream consumers to weight measurements appropriately, filtering out low-confidence readings or accounting for high uncertainty when making decisions.
