A data governance framework relies on a disciplined separation between what is being described, how it is described, and the values that populate those descriptions. Descriptive records—identified by stable keys such as RETR-0001 through RETR-0004—serve as the primary anchors for metadata artifacts like the "Sensor Drift Note," "Anomaly Flag Sheet," and "Metadata Index Card." Each record carries a pair of descriptive fields that classify the artifact's purpose and its extension, for instance pairing "Sensor Drift Note" with "Calibration Reference Sheet" or "Anomaly Flag Sheet" with "Batch Processing Note." These identifiers are not arbitrary; they provide the stable reference points that downstream processes and attribute assignments depend upon.

Attributes define the dimensions along which each descriptive record can be measured or qualified, and their types enforce a strict schema. The attribute catalog includes properties such as confidence, dimension_kind, method, and recorded_at, each bound to an XML Schema type—xsd:decimal for numeric precision, xsd:string for categorical labels, and xsd:dateTime for temporal stamps. This type discipline ensures that every value assigned to an attribute is semantically coherent: a confidence score is always a decimal, a recording timestamp is always a datetime, and a dimension kind is always a string. The same attribute taxonomy recurs across parallel record families, such as the lift-and-support-count tables, where identifiers like COUN-0001 through COUN-0004 carry the identical set of attribute definitions, enabling cross-domain comparability.

Values are stored in type-specific tables that link an entity to an attribute through a foreign-key relationship, producing a clean entity-attribute-value triad. For the descriptive records, decimal values such as 0.736 and 273.61 attach to entity RETR-0001 via attribute RETR-0001, while varchar values like "Dimension Kind 01," "Encoding 02," and "intake form" bind to the same entity through attributes RETR-0002, RETR-0008, and RETR-0009. Temporal metadata—recorded_at values such as 2024-02-12T07:34:36 and 2025-01-21T18:04:20—flows through a dedicated datetime value table, all pointing to attribute RETR-0004. This normalization by type prevents schema drift and allows each value table to be indexed and queried according to its data semantics.

Beyond static description, the framework models how metadata itself is constructed and refined through conceptual construction processes. A process such as HierarchicalEdge transforms a subject concept like "Raw Data Dictionary" into a constructed predicate called CrossReferenceLink, while Semantic Enrichment operates on "Raw Metadata Catalog" to produce Data Model Refinement. CausalDependency takes "Raw Sensor Readings" as its input and yields Schema Derivation as its output. These processes formalize the transformation pipeline: raw inputs are consumed, subject concepts are restructured, and new predicates emerge that encode relationships, provenance, and model evolution. The lift-and-support-count records—labeled "signal amplification lift," "data pipeline lift," and "sensor drift lift"—represent the quantitative outputs of such processes, with their own attribute values (confidence scores of 0.849 and 0.258, dimension kinds, and timestamps like 2024-12-28T07:07:56) providing the evidence base for governance decisions.
