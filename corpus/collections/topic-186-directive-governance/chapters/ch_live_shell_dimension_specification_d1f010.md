In governance and operational data models, entities serve as the foundational units of classification, each identified by a stable, human-readable identifier that anchors all associated metadata. A shell dimension specification, for instance, is distinguished by identifiers such as SPEC-0001 through SPEC-0004, each encoding a distinct classification—Venus_venerupis_Mediterranean, Cypraea_tigris_Asian, Littorina_obtusa_Urban, and Strombus_gigas_Tropical—where the identifier functions as the immutable key across all attribute-value associations. Similarly, school security policies are indexed by identifiers like POLI-0001 through POLI-0004, mapping to named institutions such as Cedar Ridge Preparatory, Westfield Middle School, Lincoln High School, and Sunrise International School. These identifiers are not merely labels; they are the referential fulcrum around which attribute definitions and their concrete values orbit, ensuring that every measurement, timestamp, or categorical annotation can be unambiguously traced back to its source entity.

Attributes and their types form the schema layer that describes what properties an entity can possess, decoupled from the actual data stored. The attribute name—such as confidence, dimension_kind, method, recorded_at, effective_date, enforcement, mandatory, or priority—defines a semantic dimension of measurement or description, while the attribute type constrains the permissible value domain to a specific XML Schema Definition (XSD) primitive. For shell dimension specifications, attributes include confidence typed as xsd:decimal, dimension_kind and method as xsd:string, and recorded_at as xsd:dateTime. School security policies carry their own attribute set: effective_date as xsd:date, enforcement as xsd:string, mandatory as xsd:boolean, and priority as xsd:integer. This separation of attribute definition from value storage enables flexible, type-safe extension of entity properties without schema migration, as each attribute type maps to a dedicated value table that enforces type discipline at the storage layer.

The value tables implement an entity-attribute-value (EAV) pattern, where each row binds an entity to a specific attribute and stores the actual data in a misc column whose semantics are governed by the attribute's declared type. For shell dimension specifications, decimal values such as 0.130, 733.39, 125.34, and 0.624 are stored in the decimal value table, linked to entities like SPEC-0001 and SPEC-0002 through their entity_id and attr_id foreign keys. String values—including Dimension Kind 01, Encoding 02, nightly summary, and ja—reside in the varchar value table, while timestamps such as 2024-08-09T04:20:11, 2023-01-11T02:33:00, 2025-04-11T22:51:28, and 2025-04-30T10:31:45 occupy the datetime value table. School security policies follow the same pattern: boolean values of true and false record whether a policy is mandatory, integer values like 2 and 982 capture priority scores and counts, date values such as 2023-05-09 and 2024-07-27 establish effective dates, and varchar values including Enforcement 02, intake form, and ja store free-form annotations. The misc column is thus a polymorphic container, its meaning entirely contextualized by the attr_id it is joined to.

Beyond attribute-value pairs, entities carry domain-specific relationships that express policy intent and compliance obligations. A school security policy is defined not only by its attributes but by its targets—safety objectives such as Network intrusion detection, Unauthorized access prevention, and Cyber threat intelligence—and by its must_satisfy constraints, which are constitutional constraints like OSHA workplace safety, No lethal force rule, ADA accessibility standards, and State education statutes. These relationships encode the governance logic of the system: each policy is a bridge between an operational objective and a regulatory requirement, and the identifier of the policy serves as the join key that unifies its attribute values with its safety objectives and constitutional constraints. The same structural discipline applies to distribution profiles, where identifiers like DIST-0001 through DIST-0004 link profiles such as Schema Evolution Registry, Anomaly Detection Ruleset, Schema Validation Profile, and their associated distributions—Kafka Topic Stream, JSON Schema Registry, XML Metadata Archive, Parquet Dataset—alongside their own attribute-value chains.

This architecture—where identifiers anchor entities, attribute definitions declare types, value tables store typed data, and relationship columns express policy intent—creates a queryable, extensible model for governance data. The foreign-key relationships between entity_id and attr_id in the value tables ensure referential integrity across the EAV structure, while the targets and must_satisfy columns in the policy table establish the compliance mapping that makes the data actionable for auditing and enforcement. Representative values like 0.522 and 0.997 for confidence scores, or 445.38 and 68.45 for dimensional measurements, are not isolated data points but contextualized within their entity-attribute lineage, enabling precise retrieval, validation, and cross-entity comparison across the full scope of governed objects.
