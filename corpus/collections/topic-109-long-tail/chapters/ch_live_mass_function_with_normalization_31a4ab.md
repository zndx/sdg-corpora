The measurement infrastructure distinguishes between atomic observations and their hierarchical aggregation, a separation enforced through the `fact_measurement` and `dim_aggregated_into` tables. Each measurement record carries an `identifier` that anchors it to a parent grouping via the `aggregated_into_key` column; for instance, records `INTO-0001` and `INTO-0002` both resolve to the aggregate `INTO-0005`, while `INTO-0003` and `INTO-0004` map to `INTO-0004` and `INTO-0006` respectively. The dimension table supplies the human-readable `aggregated_into_label` and `aggregated_into_category` for each grouping level, with labels such as "Aggregated Into Label 01" through "Aggregated Into Label 04" and corresponding categories "Aggregated Into Category 01" through "Aggregated Into Category 04". This two-tier structure permits roll-up queries that preserve the provenance of individual readings while exposing the categorical taxonomy under which they were consolidated.

Every measurement is accompanied by a `confidence` score and an `uncertainty` magnitude, both stored as decimal values within the fact table. Confidence values range from 0.307 for `INTO-0004` to 0.945 for `INTO-0002`, reflecting the varying degrees of assurance attached to each observation; uncertainty values, measured in the same units as the observation itself, span from 120.70 for `INTO-0003` to 364.07 for `INTO-0004`. The raw `value` column holds the measured quantity—353.34, 660.64, 878.99, and 64.10 for the four sample records—while confidence and uncertainty together provide the statistical context necessary for downstream risk assessment and quality-gate evaluation.

Material specifications are catalogued independently in `t_material_density_specification`, where each entry is identified by a `SPEC-` prefixed `identifier` and associated with a `materialdensityspecification` descriptor. The specification set includes "Monocrystalline Silicon" (`SPEC-0001`), "316 Stainless Steel" (`SPEC-0002`), "High-Density Polyethylene" (`SPEC-0003`), and "Aerogel Composite" (`SPEC-0004`). These descriptors serve as the material-level anchor for any measurement or mass-function record that references them, enabling traceability from a physical sample back to its declared composition and density class.

The mass-function tables (`t_mass_function_with_normalization` and its value-holding variants) implement a parallel attribute-value model that mirrors the material-density schema. Each mass function carries an `identifier` (e.g., `NORM-0001` through `NORM-0004`), a `mass` value such as "Rotor-Assembly-M" or "Batch-7721", and a `normalization_constant` like "Offset-0.02" or "0.982-scaling". The attribute schema is defined in `t_mass_function_with_normalization_attr`, which maps `attr_name` values—`confidence`, `dimension_kind`, `method`, `recorded_at`—to their corresponding `attr_type` in XSD form (`xsd:decimal`, `xsd:string`, `xsd:dateTime`). This separation of attribute definition from attribute value permits the same schema to be reused across both mass-function and material-density domains without schema drift.

Attribute values are stored in three type-specialized tables—`_val_decimal`, `_val_varchar`, and `_val_datetime`—each keyed by an `identifier`, an `entity_id` that references the owning mass function or specification, and an `attr_id` that resolves to the appropriate attribute definition. Decimal values such as 0.715, 279.33, 243.08, and 0.608 populate the decimal table for mass functions, while the varchar table holds strings like "Dimension Kind 01", "Encoding 02", "nightly summary", and "ja". The datetime table records timestamps such as `2024-12-04T17:58:43` and `2023-02-03T12:29:30`, providing a precise `recorded_at` point for each entity. The same pattern repeats for material-density specifications, with decimal values including 0.346, 525.66, 299.45, and 0.826, and varchar entries such as "change rationale" and "ja". This type-disaggregated value storage ensures that XSD type constraints are enforced at the storage layer while keeping the attribute model extensible.
