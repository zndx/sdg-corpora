The governance of technical artifacts—whether compliance processes, system requirements, or kernel-level hooks—depends on a disciplined separation between the entities themselves, the attributes that describe them, and the typed values that instantiate those attributes. Each entity receives a durable identifier, such as PART-0001 for an access review process or KERN-0001 for a Tracepoint-block-io kernel hook, which serves as the stable anchor across all subsequent relational joins. These identifiers are not merely labels; they are the foreign keys that connect the core entity tables to their attribute definitions and, ultimately, to the value tables where actual data resides. The process-level entities encompass activities like network synchronization and compliance audit, each linked to priority requirements through a many-to-many relationship mediated by the priority linkage table, where requirements such as Latency threshold and Backup interval are associated with specific process instances via identifiers like PRIO-0002 and PRIO-0008.

Attribute definitions establish the schema for each entity domain independently, ensuring that the same conceptual property can carry different type constraints across contexts. In the process domain, attributes such as duration_seconds, end_time, exit_code, and host_name are declared with their respective types—xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:integer, and xsd:string—while the priority domain defines effective_date as xsd:date, enforcement as xsd:string, mandatory as xsd:boolean, and priority as xsd:integer. This per-domain attribute registry allows each entity class to evolve its descriptive vocabulary without imposing cross-domain type conflicts. The kernel hook domain similarly declares its own attribute set, including checksum, created_date, identifier, and license, with types ranging from xsd:string to the domain-specific cco:DesignativeICE, demonstrating how the attribute definition layer accommodates both standard XML Schema types and custom ontological designations.

The value tables implement a type-disaggregated storage pattern, where each data type receives its own dedicated table with a uniform three-column structure: an identifier, an entity reference, and an attribute reference. This design means that the decimal value 6522.24 for a process attribute is stored in the decimal value table with entity_id PART-0002 and attr_id PART-0001, while the datetime value 2024-06-12T21:46:50 for the same entity's end_time attribute occupies the datetime value table with entity_id PART-0001 and attr_id PART-0002. Integer values such as 231 and 759 for process exit codes, string values like gw-12 and failed for host identifiers, and boolean values—all uniformly false for the mandatory attribute across all priority entities—are similarly segregated by type. The date values for priority effective dates, ranging from 2023-04-21 to 2024-08-03, and the kernel hook creation dates spanning from 2023-02-05 to 2025-01-30, follow the same disaggregated pattern, each residing in their respective typed value tables.

Cross-domain relationships are mediated through the priority linkage mechanism, which connects requirement definitions to process entities and thereby creates a traceability chain from compliance obligations to operational activities. The requirement_has_priority table maps requirements such as Throughput minimum and Audit log frequency to process identifiers like PART-0002 and PART-0005, while the priority attribute value tables store the concrete metadata for each linkage—integer priority scores of 3 and 806, date stamps of 2023-09-07 and 2024-06-06, and string descriptors including intake form and ja. This architecture ensures that every attribute value can be traced back through its entity to the requirements that govern it, and through its attribute definition to the type constraints that validate it. The kernel hook domain, while structurally parallel, operates independently with its own value tables containing identifiers such as a3f9c21e and gid://svc/77, license designations like Apache-2.0, and regional deployment markers such as eu-west-3, illustrating how the same attribute-value pattern scales across distinct operational domains without requiring shared value tables or cross-domain type coercion.
