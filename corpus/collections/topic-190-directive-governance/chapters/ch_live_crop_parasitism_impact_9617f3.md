Crop parasitism impact serves as the central analytical construct for tracking how biological interactions between parasitic weeds and agricultural systems propagate downstream effects to farming households. Each impact event receives a stable identifier—IMPA-0001 through IMPA-0004 in the reference data—and is classified under a descriptive label such as "Crop Parasitism Impact 01." These impacts are not isolated observations; they are systematically related to cultivation systems, parasitic weed hosts, and the agricultural households they affect. A single impact record can simultaneously reference multiple downstream relationships through junction tables that encode both the directionality of the relationship and the role the impact plays within it. For instance, an impact may act as the "owner" of a cultivation system it affects, or as a "contributor" or "observer" in its relationship to a parasitic weed host, with roles like "reviewer" also appearing in the household-impact linkage. The temporal provenance of these relationships is captured through a since field, with entries such as 2024-06-04 and 2023-03-28 anchoring when each impact-target association became active.

The cardinality note field provides additional structural context for these relationships, appearing in the junction tables that connect crop parasitism impacts to parasitic weed hosts and to agricultural households. Values such as "Cardinality Note 01" through "Cardinality Note 04" document the one-to-many or many-to-many constraints governing how impacts relate to their targets. This is critical for governance: knowing whether a single parasitic weed host can be associated with multiple impact records, or whether a given agricultural household can be impacted by multiple distinct parasitism events, directly affects how analysts aggregate and reason about the data. The role field complements this by specifying the semantic relationship—contributor, observer, owner, reviewer—ensuring that the same pair of entities can participate in multiple relationship types without ambiguity.

Conjunctively combines represents a separate but related analytical construct for aggregating multiple evidence sources into composite assessments. Each conjunctive combination receives its own identifier—COMB-0001 through COMB-0004—and is categorized under a category label such as "Conjunctively Combines Category 01." The core of this construct is the confidence value, which quantifies the reliability of the combined assessment on a scale from 0 to 1; reference entries include 0.738, 0.045, 0.764, and 0.799, illustrating the wide range of certainty that may attach to different combinations. Each combination also carries an uncertainty metric—736.08, 898.42, 666.33, 785.73 in the sample data—and a misc value representing the aggregated result, such as 793.45 or 980.44. The conjunctively_combines_key field links individual evidence items to their parent combination, enabling traceability from raw inputs through to the final composite score.

The attribute system provides a flexible schema for attaching typed metadata to any entity in the domain. An attr definition specifies both an attr_name—such as checksum, created_date, identifier, or license—and an attr_type that constrains the permissible value format, including xsd:string, xsd:date, and cco:DesignativeICE. Values are stored in type-specific columns: varchar columns hold string data like "c0ffee42" or "Apache-2.0," date columns store values such as "2025-05-15," and integer columns contain numeric values like 222 or 488. Each value record links back to its entity through entity_id and to its attribute definition through attr_id, creating a normalized entity-attribute-value pattern that supports extensibility without schema migration. In the product SKU domain, this mechanism attaches attributes to entities identified by identifiers like SKU-0001, with the underlying products ranging from "Pixel 8 Pro" to "PlayStation 5" and their corresponding SKUs such as "SNY-PS5-STD" and "APL-IP15-256-BLK."

Together, these constructs form a unified data architecture where identifiers provide stable references across all entity types, categories organize classifications, and confidence metrics quantify analytical certainty. The agricultural household emerges as a terminal node in the impact propagation graph, receiving effects that originate from parasitic weed interactions and are mediated through cultivation system changes. The conjunctive combination framework then allows analysts to aggregate these propagated effects into composite risk scores, each annotated with its confidence level and uncertainty bounds. This separation of concerns—between the structural relationships encoded in junction tables, the typed attribute values attached to entities, and the confidence-weighted aggregations produced by conjunctive combinations—enables both granular traceability and high-level analytical synthesis within a single coherent data model.
