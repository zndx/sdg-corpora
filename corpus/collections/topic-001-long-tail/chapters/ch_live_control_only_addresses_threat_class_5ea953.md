An identifier serves as the immutable key by which any governed entity—whether a control, a claim, or a derived attribute—is distinguished within the compliance fabric. Threat-class identifiers such as THRE-0001 through THRE-0004 anchor rows in the control-to-threat mapping table, where the control column records policy instruments like Multi-Factor Authentication and Incident Response Plan, and the addresses_risk column links each control to a claim identifier such as CLAI-0004 or CLAI-0001. Claims themselves carry their own namespace: CLAI-0001 through CLAI-0004 encode assertions like Model accuracy below SLA and File checksum matches, each of which may carry a suite of typed attributes. The entity column in the value tables denotes the subject to which an attribute value is bound—THRE-0001, CLAI-0001, SET-0001—so that the same attribute definition can be evaluated independently across multiple entities without conflating their measurements.

Attributes are named properties with declared types, and the type system constrains the shape of every value that may be attached to an entity. The attribute metadata tables enumerate attr_name and attr_type pairs: effective_date as xsd:date, enforcement as xsd:string, mandatory as xsd:boolean, priority as xsd:integer for controls; confidence as xsd:decimal, dimension_kind as xsd:string, method as xsd:string, recorded_at as xsd:dateTime for claims. These declarations are not decorative—they determine which value table receives a given datum. Boolean values such as true and false flow into the boolean value table, date literals like 2024-12-09 and 2025-01-04 into the date table, integers like 5 and 926 into the integer table, and free-form strings like Encoding 01, change rationale, and fr into the varchar table. The entity_id and attr_id columns in each value table form a composite key that binds a specific value to a specific entity and attribute, enforcing referential integrity across the type-dispatched value stores.

Attribute categories provide a second layer of organization, decoupling human-readable labels from the raw attribute keys used in facts. The dimension table maps SET-0001 through SET-0004 to attribute labels such as Attribute Label 01 and to categories like Attribute Category 01, establishing a classification hierarchy that can be queried independently of the fact data. This separation allows governance frameworks to re-categorize attributes—reassigning an attribute from one category to another—without modifying the underlying fact records or breaking existing queries. The attribute_key in the fact table references these dimension identifiers, so that every measurement in the fact table can be resolved to a category, a label, and ultimately a business meaning.

**dim_attribute**

| id | attribute_label | attribute_category |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SET-0001 | Attribute Label 01 | Attribute Category 01 |
| SET-0002 | Attribute Label 02 | Attribute Category 02 |
| SET-0003 | Attribute Label 03 | Attribute Category 03 |
| SET-0004 | Attribute Label 04 | Attribute Category 04 |
| SET-0005 | Attribute Label 05 | Attribute Category 05 |
| SET-0006 | Attribute Label 06 | Attribute Category 06 |

The fact table is the analytical core, recording measured values alongside their quality signals. Each row carries an attribute_key linking to the dimension, a numeric value such as 482.01 or 100.75, a confidence score between 0 and 1—0.926 for SET-0001, 0.123 for SET-0003—and an uncertainty magnitude like 957.49 or 455.70. Confidence and uncertainty are complementary: high confidence (0.926) accompanies a well-established measurement, while low confidence (0.123) flags a result that should be treated as provisional. The uncertainty column quantifies the absolute dispersion or error bound associated with the value, enabling downstream risk calculations that weight each fact by its reliability. Together, confidence and uncertainty transform raw measurements into auditable evidence, allowing compliance officers to distinguish between a measurement of 482.01 with confidence 0.926 and uncertainty 957.49 and one of 100.75 with confidence 0.123 and uncertainty 455.70, and to act accordingly.
