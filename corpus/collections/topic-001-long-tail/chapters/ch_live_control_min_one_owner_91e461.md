Governance frameworks require that every control be uniquely identifiable and exhaustively described before it can be audited or enforced. Identifiers such as OWNE-0001, VIA-0001, and THRE-0001 serve as the immutable keys that anchor each control, its attributes, and its observed implementations to a single authoritative reference. A control like "Rate Limit Threshold" or "Multi-Factor Authentication" is never referenced by name alone; the identifier OWNE-0001 or THRE-0001 is the stable handle that survives renaming, reclassification, and cross-referencing. This discipline of keyed identification ensures that downstream artifacts—attribute definitions, value assignments, and observation mappings—can be resolved without ambiguity, a prerequisite for any compliance regime that demands traceability from policy statement to evidence artifact.

Attributes and their types constitute the metadata layer through which controls are parameterized and qualified. Each control carries a schema of attribute definitions—effective_date typed as xsd:date, enforcement as xsd:string, mandatory as xsd:boolean, and priority as xsd:integer—that governs the shape and semantics of the values subsequently assigned. The type system is not decorative; it enforces that a date such as 2023-12-25 or 2024-12-09 is never conflated with an integer priority like 5 or 245, nor with a boolean flag such as true or false. This typed discipline applies uniformly across control families: the same four attribute names and types recur under both the OWNE and THRE prefixes, signaling a shared governance vocabulary that spans ownership directives and threat-addressing controls alike.

Entities are the governed objects to which attribute values are bound, and the value tables are the mechanism of that binding. An entity identified as OWNE-0001 or THRE-0001 receives concrete attribute assignments through dedicated value tables partitioned by type. Boolean values—false, false, true, false—record whether a property such as mandatory enforcement is active for a given entity-attribute pair. Date values—2023-01-26, 2024-02-04, 2025-01-07—capture effective dates that determine when a control or its attribute becomes operative. Integer values—5, 245, 1, 705, 99, 926—encode quantitative parameters such as priority scores or thresholds. Varchar values—Encoding 01, Enforcement 02, audit excerpt, change rationale—store free-form annotations and classification codes. The triad of entity_id, attr_id, and value forms the fundamental fact of attribute assignment, and the partitioning by value type ensures that each fact carries its own schema guarantee.

The observation model introduces a second relational dimension: controls are not merely defined and parameterized; they are also observed, validated, and evidenced through mechanisms that carry their own identities and roles. A control such as "Quality Gate Checkpoint" or "Validation Workflow Definition" is linked to an observation mechanism—Audit Log Aggregator, Quality Check Pipeline—through a relationship table that records a subject, a target, and a role. The subject is the control being observed; the target is the mechanism providing the observation; and the role—observer, reviewer, owner—describes the nature of the relationship. A control may be observed by the same mechanism in multiple capacities: VIA-0001 is linked to VIA-0004 with the role observer, while VIA-0004 is linked to VIA-0004 with the role reviewer, and VIA-0005 carries the role owner against VIA-0003. This role-annotated subject-target mapping is what transforms a static control definition into an auditable evidence chain, because it answers not only what is controlled but how, by whom, and through what instrument.

The practical significance of this structure lies in its capacity to support granular, type-safe, and fully traceable compliance reporting. An auditor can resolve from a control name to its identifier, from the identifier to its attribute schema, from each attribute to its typed values bound to specific entities, and from the control to the mechanisms that observed it, annotated by role. The same pattern repeats across threat-addressing controls: "Incident Response Plan" addresses risks such as System Downtime and Configuration Drift, carries the same attribute schema, receives typed values (true, false, 2025-01-04, 5, 926, change rationale, fr), and can be mapped to observation mechanisms through the same subject-target-role relationship. The result is a governance data model that is at once rigidly typed and richly relational, capable of representing the full lifecycle of a control from definition through parameterization to evidence collection without losing any thread of provenance.
