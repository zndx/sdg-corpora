Within observability and service governance frameworks, the integrity of event-driven analytics depends on a disciplined separation between measured quantities and their descriptive metadata. Each service invocation is anchored by a unique identifier—SERV-0001 through SERV-0004 in the directory fact table—that serves as the primary key for all downstream joins. These identifiers are not merely labels; they are the structural fulcrum around which event counts, target classifications, and response mappings rotate. A single service record, for instance, may report an event count of 397 while simultaneously referencing a target user and a generated response through foreign keys, thereby collapsing what would otherwise be a sprawling denormalized log into a single analytical row. The event count itself—ranging from 81 to 397 across the directory—functions as the quantitative heartbeat of the system, enabling capacity planning and anomaly detection without requiring re-aggregation from raw telemetry.

The descriptive richness of each service record emerges from its relationships to dimension tables that classify both the intended recipient and the system's output. The targets user dimension assigns a categorical label and a human-readable misc label to each recipient profile, with categories such as Targets User Category 01 through 04 providing a coarse-grained taxonomy for access control and audit reporting. Similarly, the generates response dimension attaches its own category and misc label to each system output, enabling downstream dashboards to filter or aggregate by response type without parsing unstructured log text. These two dimensions are joined to the fact directory through their respective foreign keys, meaning that a service record with identifier SERV-0001 might reference target user SERV-0001 and generate response SERV-0006, each carrying their own categorical and misc metadata. The result is a star schema where the fact table holds the measurable quantities and the dimension tables supply the semantic context necessary for governance queries.

Conjunctive analysis introduces a second analytical layer that evaluates how multiple conditions combine to produce a composite outcome. The conjunctive fact table records each combination with its own identifier—COMB-0001 through COMB-0004—and links to a dimension table that categorizes the combination type. Crucially, each conjunctive record carries a confidence value and an uncertainty measure alongside a computed value. Confidence values span a wide range, from a low of 0.045 to a high of 0.799, reflecting the varying degrees of certainty that the system assigns to different logical conjunctions. The uncertainty metric, expressed as a floating-point quantity such as 736.08 or 898.42, quantifies the dispersion or risk associated with each combination, while the value column—ranging from 598.69 to 980.44—represents the aggregated or derived result of the conjunctive operation. Together, these three numeric fields enable risk-weighted decisioning: a combination with high confidence and low uncertainty carries substantially more operational weight than one with the inverse profile, even if their computed values are comparable.

At the telemetry layer, the attribute model captures the fine-grained properties of individual system calls through an entity-attribute-value pattern that separates schema from data. The attribute definition table declares each property by name—duration_seconds, end_time, exit_code, host_name—and assigns it an XSD type such as xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:integer, or xsd:string. This type annotation determines which value table receives the corresponding measurement. Decimal attributes like duration_seconds, with values such as 5668.45 or 293.20, are stored in the decimal value table; integer attributes like exit_code, with values such as 7 or 420, reside in the integer value table; and string attributes like host_name, with values such as node-a01 or closeout, are persisted in the varchar value table. The entity_id column in each value table references the system call record, while the attr_id column points to the attribute definition, creating a normalized graph that supports arbitrary attribute expansion without schema migration. This design allows the same entity—SYSC-0001, for example—to carry a duration of 5668.45, an end time of 2025-06-18T16:09:11, an exit code of 7, and a host name of node-a01, each drawn from a different value table but unified through the entity identifier.
