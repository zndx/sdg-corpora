The tracking of process executions relies on a disciplined separation between entity identity, attribute definition, and attribute value, a tripartite structure that ensures type safety and query efficiency across heterogeneous operational data. Each process or artifact is assigned a unique identifier—`ICE-0001` through `ICE-0004` for ice-producing processes such as Plate freezing, Cryogenic freezing, Spray cooling, and Direct expansion freezing, and `ARTI-0001` through `ARTI-0004` for downstream artifacts including Schema migration job, Data quality validation, Provenance capture run, and Batch ingestion run. These identifiers serve as the immutable anchor points around which all observational metadata is organized, guaranteeing that every measurement, timestamp, and status code can be traced back to a single execution context without ambiguity.

Attribute definitions are catalogued independently of their values, with each attribute declared by name and typed according to the XML Schema standard. The attribute registry captures properties such as `duration_seconds`, `end_time`, `exit_code`, and `host_name`, each bound to a precise type: `xsd:decimal` for numeric durations, `xsd:dateTime` for temporal endpoints, `xsd:integer` for discrete counters, and `xsd:string` for free-form labels. This schema-level discipline means that the system enforces type correctness at the point of ingestion rather than deferring validation to downstream consumers. A duration of `5646.64` seconds for one ice-producing process and `148.27` seconds for a schema migration job are stored in their respective decimal value tables, while exit codes such as `140`, `235`, `217`, and `99` reside in the integer value store, and host identifiers like `node-a01` and log level descriptors such as `Log Level 02` are persisted as variable-character strings.

The value tables themselves implement a type-partitioned design, with separate stores for datetime, decimal, integer, and varchar data. Each row in a value table carries an entity identifier that references the process or artifact being observed, an attribute identifier that points to the definition in the attribute registry, and the actual value. For instance, the datetime table records `2024-12-21T05:38:52` and `2023-10-15T09:29:56` as end times for specific executions, while the decimal table captures `6078.60` and `2298.30` as duration measurements. This partitioning strategy avoids the storage overhead and query ambiguity of a single wide-value column, at the cost of requiring joins across the attribute registry to reconstruct a complete observation. The entity identifier in each value row—`ICE-0001`, `ICE-0002`, `ARTI-0001`, `ARTI-0002`—ties the measurement back to its source, while the attribute identifier—`ICE-0001`, `ICE-0002`, `ARTI-0001`, `ARTI-0002`—resolves to the human-readable attribute name and its declared type.

Beyond the core attribute-value machinery, the operational model captures scheduling and resilience metadata through dedicated columns on the process-artifact relationship. The `retry_count` field records how many times a process was retried before reaching its final state, with values ranging from `28` for a data quality validation to `487` for a trace sampling operation, reflecting the varying degrees of operational instability across different workload types. The `scheduled_at` timestamp anchors each process to its intended execution window, with entries such as `2025-02-18T02:41:43` for a log shipment and `2024-07-19T11:09:21` for an index rebuild, enabling post-hoc analysis of scheduling adherence and drift. Together, these fields provide a minimal but sufficient audit trail: an identifier for the process, a count of retries, and a scheduled start time, all of which can be correlated with the attribute values to reconstruct the full lifecycle of any given execution.
