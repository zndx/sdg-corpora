Within the governance and operational data model, every observable fact is anchored to a stable identifier and contextualized through a typed attribute system. Identifiers such as SPEC-0001, ICE-0001, and SIGN-0001 serve as the immutable keys that distinguish one entity from another across the three principal domains: shell dimension specifications, ice-producing processes, and signed attestations. A shell dimension specification entity, for instance, carries a human-readable designation like Venus_venerupis_Mediterranean or Cypraea_tigris_Asian, while a process entity encodes its operational modality through values such as Plate freezing, Cryogenic freezing, or Spray cooling. An attestation entity, meanwhile, identifies the compliance artifact itself—System Access Certification, Data Lineage Certification, or Privacy Impact Assessment—each of which is subsequently enriched with structured metadata. The entity concept thus functions as the pivot around which all attribute-value pairs revolve; it is the foreign key that binds a measurement, a timestamp, or a categorical label back to the thing being described.

Attributes are declared once in a dedicated registry and referenced by every value table that stores their data. The attribute definition table—t_shell_dimension_specification_attr for the shell domain, t_process_produces_ice_attr for the process domain, and t_attestation_signed_by_attr for the attestation domain—maps each attribute identifier to a name and a type. Attribute names such as confidence, dimension_kind, method, and recorded_at appear in the shell specification registry; duration_seconds, end_time, exit_code, and host_name appear in both the process and attestation registries, reflecting a shared vocabulary across operational and compliance domains. The attr_type column enforces schema discipline by assigning each attribute an XSD type: xsd:decimal for numeric measurements, xsd:string for free-form text, xsd:dateTime for temporal markers, and xsd:integer for whole-number codes. This type declaration is not merely documentation; it dictates which value table—val_datetime, val_decimal, val_int, or val_varchar—receives the data, ensuring that a value of 0.130 or 733.39 is stored in the decimal table, a timestamp like 2024-08-09T04:20:11 in the datetime table, and a string such as Dimension Kind 01 or ingest-21 in the varchar table.

The value tables themselves implement a type-disaggregated entity-attribute-value pattern, where the misc column holds the actual data payload and the entity_id and attr_id columns form the composite foreign-key relationship to the entity and attribute registries. In the shell dimension specification domain, the decimal value table records measurements such as 0.130 and 125.34 against entity SPEC-0001, while the varchar table stores categorical labels like nightly summary and ja for the same entity. The datetime table captures temporal provenance—2023-01-11T02:33:00, 2025-04-11T22:51:28—allowing auditors to trace when a dimension was recorded. In the process domain, the decimal value table stores duration_seconds values of 5646.64 and 2298.30 for Plate freezing and Spray cooling processes respectively, while the integer table records exit codes such as 140 and 217, and the varchar table captures host identifiers like ingest-21 and operational states such as running. The attestation domain mirrors this structure precisely: decimal values of 2368.11 and 785.50 represent duration_seconds for System Access Certification and Privacy Impact Assessment attestations, integer values of 407 and 633 encode exit codes, and varchar values such as gw-12 and pending capture host and status metadata.

The foreign-key architecture creates a three-layer join path that reconstructs any attribute value from its constituent parts. To retrieve the recorded_at timestamp for a shell dimension specification, one joins the value table on attr_id to the attribute registry to confirm the type is xsd:dateTime, and on entity_id to the specification registry to confirm the entity is, for example, Littorina_obtusa_Urban. This same join pattern applies uniformly across all three domains, enabling a single query engine to navigate between shell specifications, ice-producing processes, and compliance attestations without domain-specific schema knowledge. The consistency of the attr_id and entity_id columns across type-specific value tables means that an attribute such as duration_seconds—present in both the process and attestation registries with the same xsd:decimal type—can be queried through a unified interface, with the value tables disambiguating the domain through their table name and the entity_id prefix (ICE- versus SIGN-). This design supports extensibility: new attributes can be registered without modifying any value table, and new entity types can be introduced by adding a new attribute registry and a corresponding set of value tables, all following the same structural contract.
