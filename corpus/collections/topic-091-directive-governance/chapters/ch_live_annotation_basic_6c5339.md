An identifier serves as the immutable anchor for every record in the annotation and classification registries, guaranteeing that each entity can be referenced unambiguously across the system. Identifiers follow a disciplined prefix scheme—ANNO-0001 through ANNO-0004 for annotation records and CLAS-0001 through CLAS-0004 for classification records—each encoding both the domain and a sequential ordinal. The annotation identifiers carry descriptive payloads such as "Lab sample preservation log," "Dataset quality flag," "Observation confidence score," and "Model versioning record," while classification identifiers are paired with operational categories like "sensor calibration," "data validation," and "pipeline orchestration." This dual-layer naming convention—machine-parseable prefix plus human-readable descriptor—enables both automated joins and manual audit without ambiguity.

Attributes and their types constitute the schema layer that gives structure to otherwise flat records. The attribute definition tables enumerate property names such as confidence, dimension_kind, method, recorded_at, duration_seconds, end_time, exit_code, and host_name, each bound to an XSD type—xsd:decimal, xsd:string, xsd:dateTime, or xsd:integer—that dictates how values are validated, stored, and compared. Type discipline is enforced through value partitioning: decimal values like 0.902, 146.86, and 292.49 reside in dedicated decimal value tables; temporal values such as 2023-10-01T01:18:56 and 2025-03-10T03:55:42 are isolated in datetime stores; and free-form strings including "Dimension Kind 01," "Encoding 02," "intake form," "fr," "worker-07," and "Log Level 02" occupy varchar tables. This separation by type eliminates null-handling ambiguity and ensures that a decimal comparison never collides with a string sort.

The entity column is the relational glue that binds attribute definitions to their concrete values. In the value tables, entity_id references the primary key of the owning record—ANNO-0001 may carry a confidence of 0.902, a dimension_kind of "Dimension Kind 01," and a recorded_at timestamp of 2023-10-01T01:18:56—while attr_id points to the attribute definition that describes what those values mean. A single entity can thus accumulate a heterogeneous set of typed properties without any schema migration: the observation record STAT-0001, for instance, carries a duration_seconds of 4243.13, an exit_code of 958, a host_name of "worker-07," and a status of "execution," each drawn from its respective typed value table and unified under one entity identifier. The misc column in these value tables holds the actual scalar value, decoupled from both the attribute's name and its type declaration, which permits the same attribute definition to be reused across entities with different value domains.

Phase and triggered_by capture the operational lifecycle of a classification, recording where a process stands and what initiated it. The phase column distinguishes between stages such as execution and review, while triggered_by records the origin of the transition—schedule, manual, or retry. A classification entry for "sensor calibration" may appear in the execution phase triggered by a schedule, while an identical classification for "sensor calibration" may appear in the review phase triggered by a manual override or a retry after failure. This separation of state from causation enables audit trails that answer not only what phase a process is in but why it entered that phase, supporting compliance requirements where the provenance of a state change is as important as the state itself.

The observation records layer extends this model to incident tracking, where observations such as "Network latency spike," "Water quality anomaly," and "Reactor pressure threshold" are paired with supporting artifacts like "Event log manifest," "Sensor data packet," and "Diagnostic trace file." Each observation record carries its own set of typed attributes—duration_seconds ranging from 1567.00 to 5274.11, exit_codes from 41 to 517, host_names like "worker-07," and status indicators such as "execution" and "pending"—all resolved through the same entity-attr-value pattern. The uniformity of this structure across annotations, classifications, and observations means that a single query engine can traverse the full provenance chain from a high-level classification through its constituent observations to the raw attribute values that substantiate it, without requiring domain-specific join logic.
