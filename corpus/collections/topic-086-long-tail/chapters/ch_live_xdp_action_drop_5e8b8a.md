The classification and assignment architecture rests on a layered schema where identifiers serve as the primary linkage mechanism across fact and dimension tables. Each operational event receives a unique identifier—DROP-0001 through DROP-0004 for network action records, RECO-0001 through RECO-0004 for division assignments, and CLAI-0001 through CLAI-0004 for production outliers—establishing a deterministic reference point that propagates through the entire data model. These identifiers anchor the core action records in t_xdp_action_drop, where each entry maps a network interface such as wlan0_monitor, veth1_filter, docker0_hook, or nfqueue_bridge to a specific enforcement action including quarantine, conntrack_drop, acl_denied, and threat_block. The identifier thus functions not merely as a surrogate key but as the semantic anchor through which all downstream attribute values, entity associations, and classification metadata are resolved.

Attribute definitions and their typed values form the second structural layer, decoupling schema from data through a normalized attribute-value model. The attribute registry in t_xdp_action_drop_attr declares each attribute by name—checksum, created_date, identifier, license—alongside its corresponding type constraint, which spans xsd:string, xsd:date, and cco:DesignativeICE. Typed value tables then materialize these declarations: date attributes resolve to values such as 2025-02-22, 2023-10-04, 2025-04-21, and 2023-05-09; integer attributes carry magnitudes like 265, 7, 394, and 7; and variable-character attributes encode identifiers and policy references including 1a4b6c2d, urn:uuid:9f2a, CC-BY-4.0, and us-east-1. The entity column in each value table establishes the many-to-many relationship between an attribute definition and the concrete records it qualifies, enabling a single attribute such as DROP-0002 to be associated with multiple entity instances across the dataset.

Division assignment records introduce a probabilistic dimension to the classification framework, where each fact_division entry links an assigns_athlete to an assigns_division through their respective foreign keys while simultaneously carrying a confidence score and an uncertainty measure. Confidence values range from 0.083 to 0.806, reflecting the model's varying degrees of certainty in each assignment decision, while uncertainty values span from 96.89 to 740.08, providing a complementary measure of dispersion. The associated misc value—330.50, 254.97, 407.11, 404.52—captures an additional quantitative dimension of the assignment, potentially representing a derived score or threshold metric. The athlete and division dimensions themselves are catalogued in separate reference tables, each carrying a human-readable label and a category designation, enabling both machine-resolvable lookups and human-interpretable reporting.

Production outlier records complete the operational observability layer by capturing execution characteristics of classified events. The fact_outlier table records duration_seconds values ranging from 1182.39 to 6466.78, exit codes spanning 4 to 760, and retry counts from 101 to 308, each tied to a produces_key that references the originating production record. The produces dimension provides categorical context through its own category linkage, with category identifiers such as CLAI-0004 and CLAI-0002 establishing the classification bucket to which each production event belongs. The produces_label and produces_category columns in the dimension table supply the descriptive metadata that transforms raw numeric observations into actionable operational intelligence, while the category_name table offers an additional normalization layer for reporting and aggregation purposes.
