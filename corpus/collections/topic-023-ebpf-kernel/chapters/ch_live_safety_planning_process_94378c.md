Safety planning processes in domestic violence intervention systems are modeled as first-class entities with identifiers such as PROC-0001 through PROC-0004, each associated with a named protocol—SAFEPLAN-RED, VICTIM-ADVOC-12, SHIELD-PROTOCOL, or COMMUNITY-SAFE—that encodes the operational methodology deployed. These processes are not abstract; they are instantiated against specific domestic violence survivors, identified by codes such as CLIENT-7734, WITNESS-119, SURV-2024-X, and REFUGEE-771, establishing a direct linkage between procedural design and the individuals it serves. The relationship between process and survivor is mediated through a junction entity that assigns a role—owner, observer, or reviewer—to each pairing, thereby encoding governance and accountability within the intervention workflow. A process may target multiple survivors, and a survivor may be subject to multiple processes, with the cardinality of each association explicitly documented.

The operational capacity of a safety planning process is defined by the crisis intervention methods it employs. Methods such as HOTLINE-TRIAGE, LEGAL-ADVOCACY, SAFE-ROOM-SET, and DOCUMENT-GATHER are catalogued as distinct entities, each linked to one or more processes through a separate association table that similarly records the role of the process in invoking the method and a cardinality note—Cardinality Note 01 through Cardinality Note 04—specifying the nature and constraints of the invocation. This dual-junction architecture, with one association table for survivor targets and another for intervention methods, ensures that both the beneficiary and the means of intervention are independently governed, with roles and cardinality constraints tracked separately and without conflation.

Verification activities follow a parallel but structurally distinct pattern, organized around verification subclasses such as Compliance renewal verification, GDPR data flow review, and Security posture assessment. Rather than embedding attribute values directly within the verification record, the schema employs an entity-attribute-value decomposition: each verification subclass declares its attributes—duration_seconds, end_time, exit_code, host_name—alongside their typed definitions (xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:integer, xsd:string), and the actual values are stored in type-specialized value tables. A single verification entity, VERI-0001, for instance, carries a duration of 5469.69 seconds, an end time of 2024-10-23T14:58:17, an exit code of 616, and a host name of node-a01, with each value residing in its respective typed store and linked back to the entity through foreign keys.

The eBPF map registry introduces an infrastructure-oriented dimension, mapping kernel-level data structures—sock_hash, cpumap, conntrack_map, flow_table—to their pinned filesystem paths such as /run/bpf/sockops and /sys/fs/bpf/cilium_flow. Ownership of these maps is assigned to operational teams (sre, data-engineering), and each entry carries metadata tags—pii, internal, verified—that classify the sensitivity and compliance posture of the associated resource. This table operates independently of the safety planning and verification domains but shares the same foundational design principle: every resource is identified, attributed, and governed through explicit, queryable relationships rather than implicit or embedded state.
