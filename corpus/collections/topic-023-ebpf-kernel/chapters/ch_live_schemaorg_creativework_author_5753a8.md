The architecture of provenance and measurement tracking rests upon a disciplined separation between entities, their attributes, and the values those attributes assume at particular points in time. Each entity receives a stable identifier—AUTH-0001 through AUTH-0004 for creative-work authorship records, DIRE-0001 through DIRE-0004 for eBPF program directives, and METH-0001 through METH-0005 for measurement methods—ensuring that every fact can be referenced unambiguously across the system. An entity such as the API_Reference_Guide, attributed to the WorkflowEngineer, or the tracepoint_sched eBPF program governed by a compliance directive, constitutes a distinct subject of inquiry whose properties are captured through a schema of named attributes. These attributes—checksum, created_date, identifier, and license for creative works; effective_date, enforcement, mandatory, and priority for directives—are themselves typed with precision: xsd:string for textual identifiers like 7b14de08 or gid://svc/77, xsd:date for temporal markers such as 2023-12-01 or 2024-06-04, xsd:boolean for enforcement flags, and xsd:integer for numeric quantities like a priority of 280 or a value of 363. The attr_type column encodes this type information using standard XML Schema and Common Crawl Ontology datatypes, enabling downstream consumers to validate and coerce values without schema introspection at query time.

The value tables implement a vertical partitioning strategy that aligns each attribute's data type with its own storage domain, thereby eliminating null-padding and type-coercion overhead at read time. A single entity may carry multiple attributes of different types: the creative-work entity AUTH-0001, for instance, stores its license as the varchar value GPL-3.0 in the varchar value table, its created_date as 2023-12-01 in the date value table, and its integer attributes—363 and 12—across separate integer value rows, each linked back through the entity_id foreign key. This design mirrors the practice of separating heterogeneous measurements in experimental science, where UV–ozone cross-linking effects on polymer elastic modulus are recorded alongside plasticizer concentration and ambient temperature, each in its own calibrated channel. The attr_id column in each value table serves as the join key to the attribute definition table, establishing a many-to-one relationship between value rows and their schema-level declarations.

Measurement facts introduce two additional dimensions of rigor: confidence and uncertainty, which quantify the reliability and dispersion of observed values respectively. The fact_measurement table records individual observations—353.34, 660.64, 878.99, 64.10—each accompanied by a confidence score ranging from 0.307 to 0.945 and an uncertainty magnitude spanning 120.70 to 364.07. A measurement with confidence 0.945 and uncertainty 279.24 carries substantially more evidentiary weight than one with confidence 0.307 and uncertainty 364.07, even when their raw values are comparable. The via_method_key column in fact_measurement references the dim_via_method dimension table, which classifies each measurement method by a categorical label such as Via Method Category 01 through 04. This foreign-key linkage enables aggregation and comparison of measurements by method category, analogous to grouping experimental results by the spectroscopic technique employed—Raman, FTIR, or XRD—when assessing polymer nanostructure.

| METH-0002 | METH-0002 | 0.945 | 279.24 | 660.64 |

The category field in the dimension table provides a coarse-grained taxonomy that supports analytical rollups across heterogeneous measurement methods. When a measurement's via_method_key resolves to METH-0003, for example, the associated via_method_category of Via Method Category 03 situates that observation within a broader methodological family, permitting cross-method comparisons that would otherwise be obscured by the granularity of individual method labels. This hierarchical classification—method label to method category—parallels the way scientific disciplines organize measurement protocols under shared epistemic frameworks, where the provenance of a data point is as important as its numerical value. The entity_id columns in the value tables and the via_method_key in the fact table both function as foreign keys to their respective entity and dimension tables, creating a navigable graph of provenance that traces any observed value back through its attribute definition, its governing entity, and, in the case of measurements, its methodological origin.
