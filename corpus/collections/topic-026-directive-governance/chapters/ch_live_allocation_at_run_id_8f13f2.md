In metadata-intensive environments, the distinction between what an entity is, what properties it carries, and how those properties are typed forms the backbone of traceable governance. An entity serves as the primary subject of inquiry—a particular audit engagement such as a SOC2 Type II Review or a HIPAA Security Audit, or a descriptive record like a Sensor Drrift Note or Anomaly Flag Sheet—each assigned a stable identifier (AUDI-0001, RETR-0001, and so forth) that anchors all subsequent attribute-value bindings. The identifier is not merely a label; it is the referent that permits cross-referencing across type-specific value stores, ensuring that a duration of 6622.09 seconds or a confidence score of 0.736 can be unambiguously traced back to its originating entity.

Attributes define the dimensions along which entities are measured and classified. Each attribute carries a name—duration_seconds, end_time, exit_code, host_name, confidence, dimension_kind, method, recorded_at—and a type drawn from the XSD vocabulary (xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:integer, xsd:string). This type declaration is not decorative; it dictates the physical storage strategy. Decimal-valued attributes such as duration_seconds or confidence are persisted in dedicated decimal value tables, datetime attributes like end_time or recorded_at in their own stores, integer-valued attributes such as exit_code in integer tables, and string-valued attributes including host_name, dimension_kind, and method in varchar tables. The value 2023-11-27T16:16:19, for instance, resides in the datetime value table because its attribute (end_time) is typed xsd:dateTime; the integer 943 appears in the integer value table because its attribute (exit_code) is xsd:integer. This type-dispatched storage model preserves data integrity at query time while avoiding the pitfalls of a single monolithic value column.

The entity-attribute-value binding itself is mediated through an entity_id column that references the primary entity and an attr_id column that references the attribute definition. A single entity may carry multiple attributes of different types: entity AUDI-0001, for example, has a decimal value of 6622.09 (duration_seconds), a datetime value of 2023-11-27T16:16:19 (end_time), an integer value of 943 (exit_code), and string values including node-b14 (host_name) and Log Level 02 (a second attribute). This multi-typed attribute profile is the norm rather than the exception, and the schema accommodates it by distributing values across type-specific tables while maintaining a unified entity reference.

Beyond attribute-value bindings, the system models relationships between entities through subject-target-role triples. In the allocation domain, an allocation such as batch-etl-override or model-training-v3 (identified by RUN-0001, RUN-0002, and so on) is linked to a run identifier—exec-token-4491, job-context-99a, tx-id-7721b, run-7a2b4c1d—through a junction table that records the role assumed by the subject in relation to the target. The role observer appears in three of four recorded bindings; the role reviewer appears once. These role-labeled associations are not metadata about attributes but metadata about relationships, and they enable fine-grained access control, audit trails, and provenance tracking. An allocation that acts as observer against a run identifier carries different semantic weight than one acting as reviewer, and the schema preserves this distinction explicitly.

The descriptive subclass mirrors the audit subclass in structure but serves a different operational purpose. Records such as Sensor Drift Note, Anomaly Flag Sheet, Metadata Index Card, and Calibration Reference Sheet carry attributes like confidence (typed xsd:decimal with values ranging from 0.217 to 0.736), dimension_kind and method (xsd:string), and recorded_at (xsd:dateTime with timestamps spanning from 2024-02-12T07:34:36 to 2025-01-21T18:04:20). The parallel schema design between audit and descriptive subclasses ensures that governance queries can traverse both domains uniformly, while the type-specific value tables guarantee that a decimal confidence score is never conflated with a datetime timestamp or a string encoding label. This disciplined separation of concerns—entity, attribute, type, value, role—is what makes the system auditable, extensible, and resilient to schema evolution.
