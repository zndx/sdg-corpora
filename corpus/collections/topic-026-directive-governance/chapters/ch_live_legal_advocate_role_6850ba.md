Within this data model, every entity is anchored by a unique identifier that serves as the primary key for all relational joins and lookups. Legal advocate roles are catalogued in a dedicated table where each role identifier—such as ROLE-0001 through ROLE-0004—maps to a descriptive role code like LegalAid-Case33, CourtAdvoc-15B, or SurvivorAdvoc-118, encoding both the function and the case context. The individuals who hold these roles are stored separately as persons—Priya Nair, Robert Kim, Aisha B. Williams, and Marcus Chen—linked to their respective roles through a junction table that also assigns an operational role such as reviewer or contributor, thereby separating the definition of a role from its assignment and enabling many-to-many relationships between advocates and role bearers.

The model captures the substantive relationships between legal advocates and the domestic violence survivors they serve through dedicated association tables. A legal advocate role may assist one or more survivors, identified by reference codes such as Case-Client-004, DV-Record-338, or Ref-Survivor-091. These associations are themselves first-class records with their own identifiers and carry an additional role attribute—observer, contributor, or owner—that specifies the nature of the advocate's engagement with each survivor. A cardinality note accompanies each association, providing structured metadata about the scope or constraints of the relationship, which is essential for auditing and for enforcing business rules around caseload limits and access permissions.

Measurement and quality dimensions are captured through a fact-dimension architecture centered on cardinality. The fact table records quantitative observations keyed by a cardinality identifier and a cardinality key that references a dimension record. Each fact carries a confidence score—ranging from 0.226 to 0.994 in the observed data—alongside an uncertainty magnitude expressed as a numeric value such as 284.36 or 622.09, and a measured value like 728.94 or 380.57. The dimension table provides the human-readable label and category for each cardinality, enabling aggregation and filtering by category while preserving the full numeric precision in the fact table for analytical queries.

Schema evolution is tracked through a versioning mechanism that records when individual columns were introduced into the data model. Each version entry identifies the column name—throughput_mbps, geo_lat_dd, batch_number, air_pressure_hpa—and the schema version in which it was added, such as telemetry_v4.0 or prod_v5.2. Attribute metadata is maintained separately, specifying the attribute name and its XSD type—xsd:decimal, xsd:string, or xsd:dateTime—allowing the system to enforce type safety across heterogeneous value stores. Actual attribute values are partitioned into type-specific tables: decimal values like 0.705 or 536.45 in one table, datetime values such as 2025-04-06T14:28:17 in another, and string values like Dimension Kind 01 or change rationale in a third, each linked back to its entity and attribute through foreign keys.
