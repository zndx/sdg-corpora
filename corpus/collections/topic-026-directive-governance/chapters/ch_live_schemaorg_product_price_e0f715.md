The data model centers on a disciplined separation between entity definitions, attribute schemas, and their runtime values—a pattern that supports extensibility without sacrificing type safety. At the core of this architecture, entities such as professional expertise domains and operational processes are identified by stable keys like DOMA-0001 and PROC-0001, each carrying domain-specific metadata. A Cybersecurity Auditor, for instance, is registered as covering the Manufacturing Operations sector and providing Asset Valuation services, while a Forensic Accountant serves Public Infrastructure with Contract Drafting capabilities. Similarly, operational processes such as incident response, data validation, telemetry aggregation, and batch ingestion are each assigned unique identifiers that anchor their associated metadata. This separation ensures that the structural definition of an entity remains decoupled from the values it holds at any given moment, enabling schema evolution without disrupting existing data.

Attribute definitions form the bridge between entity types and their measurable characteristics. Each entity class declares its attributes through a dedicated schema table that pairs attribute names with their semantic types. For professional expertise domains, attributes include confidence (typed as xsd:decimal), dimension_kind (xsd:string), method (xsd:string), and recorded_at (xsd:dateTime). Process entities carry their own attribute set—duration_seconds as xsd:decimal, end_time as xsd:dateTime, exit_code as xsd:integer, and host_name as xsd:string. The attr_type column encodes the expected data format, which governs how values are stored, validated, and queried. This typed attribute registry is what allows the model to route values into the correct storage table without requiring a single monolithic value column.

Value storage follows a type-partitioned strategy: decimal, integer, string, and datetime values are persisted in separate tables, each keyed by entity_id and attr_id to reconstruct the attribute-value pairs at query time. A Cybersecurity Auditor entity (DOMA-0001) might hold a confidence score of 0.863 and a dimension value of 628.37 in the decimal store, while the same entity records Dimension Kind 01 and calibration record as string values, and 2024-07-30T07:07:17 as a timestamp. Process entities exhibit the same pattern: incident response (PROC-0001) logs a duration of 5106.96 seconds, an exit code of 684, a host name of worker-07, and an end time of 2025-01-11T16:52:13. The misc column in each value table holds the actual data, while the entity_id and attr_id columns provide the foreign-key context that ties each value back to its entity and attribute definition. This partitioning by type avoids the pitfalls of untyped value columns and enables efficient indexing on numeric and temporal fields.

Relationships between entities are captured through junction tables that encode not only the subject-to-target linkage but also the role each party plays in the relationship. In the product pricing domain, a schemaorg product identifier such as PRIC-0001 (Apple AirPods Pro) is linked to a price identifier like PRIC-0007 with a role of contributor, while the same product may also be linked to PRIC-0001 with a role of reviewer. This role column is critical: it distinguishes between a price that was set by a contributor and one that was validated by a reviewer, enabling audit trails and governance workflows that depend on understanding who acted in what capacity. The subject column identifies the originating entity, the target column identifies the related entity, and the role column provides the semantic context for the relationship—transforming a simple many-to-many link into a governed, auditable association.

Together, these patterns—stable identifiers, typed attribute schemas, type-partitioned value stores, and role-aware relationships—form a coherent data governance framework. The identifier column provides the primary key for every entity and relationship record, ensuring referential integrity across the model. The attr and attr_type columns define what can be measured and in what format, while the entity and attr_id columns in the value tables reconstruct those measurements at query time. The industrysector and servicetype columns on domain entities provide categorical classification that supports filtering and reporting, and the role column on relationship tables provides the governance context needed for compliance auditing. This architecture scales because adding a new attribute requires only a row in the attribute schema table and new rows in the appropriate value table—no schema migration, no application code changes, and no disruption to existing queries.
