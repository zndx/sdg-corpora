In distributed systems and audit frameworks, every observable event or resource must be captured as an entity—a discrete, identifiable thing about which information is recorded. An entity is distinguished by an identifier, a stable key that guarantees uniqueness across the system. Consider the audit evidence records identified as AUDI-0001 through AUDI-0004, each representing a distinct artifact such as AuditTrail_20231015, ChainOfCustody_Batch44, or SignatureBlock_99A1. Similarly, network security actions like wlan0_monitor, veth1_filter, docker0_hook, and nfqueue_bridge are each assigned identifiers DROP-0001 through DROP-0004, anchoring them as first-class entities within the data model. These identifiers serve as the primary keys that enable reliable joins, lookups, and referential integrity across all downstream tables.

Attributes are the properties or characteristics that describe an entity. Rather than embedding every property as a fixed column, the model defines attributes as first-class metadata entries, each with a name and a type. For instance, the audit evidence entities carry attributes such as confidence, dimension_kind, method, and recorded_at, while the network action entities carry checksum, created_date, identifier, and license. The attribute type constrains the kind of value that can be assigned: xsd:decimal for numeric precision, xsd:string for free-form text, xsd:dateTime and xsd:date for temporal values, and even domain-specific types like cco:DesignativeICE for designative identifiers. This separation of attribute definition from attribute value allows the schema to remain extensible—new attributes can be introduced without schema migrations, and each attribute's type is declared once and enforced at write time.

Attribute values, stored as misc data, are materialized in type-specific value tables that reference both the entity and the attribute. An entity can carry multiple attributes, and each attribute can hold a single value per entity. The audit evidence record AUDI-0001, for example, has a confidence value of 0.978 stored in the decimal value table, a recorded_at timestamp of 2024-10-15T21:07:57 in the datetime table, and a dimension_kind of Dimension Kind 01 in the varchar table. The network action DROP-0001 carries a checksum of 1a4b6c2d, a created_date of 2025-02-22, a license of CC-BY-4.0, and a numeric value of 265. This value-per-type strategy avoids NULL proliferation and ensures that each value is stored in the most appropriate column type, simplifying both validation and query performance.

Beyond describing individual entities, the model also captures relationships between them through subject, target, and role. A subject is the entity on the initiating side of a relationship, while a target is the entity on the receiving side, and the role describes the nature of the connection. In the trace-to-service mapping, trace records such as notif-send-8876 and inventory-sync-2290 are linked to service records like inventory-db, order-processor, and metrics-collector. The relationship between a trace and a service is not merely a foreign key—it carries a role such as observer, owner, or reviewer, which semantically qualifies how the subject participates with respect to the target. A single trace can relate to multiple services under different roles, and a single service can be the target of multiple traces, enabling rich, multi-dimensional relationship graphs without requiring additional junction tables.

Together, these constructs—identifier, entity, attr, attr type, misc, subject, target, and role—form a unified data model that supports both descriptive metadata and relational semantics. The model scales across domains: it captures the provenance of audit evidence with precise timestamps and confidence scores, it records the configuration and classification of network security actions with checksums and licensing terms, and it maps the interactions between distributed services with role-qualified relationships. By separating identity, definition, and value, and by treating relationships as first-class constructs with semantic roles, the framework provides a foundation for compliance auditing, operational observability, and governance that is both flexible and rigorously structured.
