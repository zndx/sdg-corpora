In operational data governance, every observable event or procedural action is captured as an entity anchored by a unique identifier and contextual metadata. A trace such as `load-balancer-routing` or `worker-task-execution` represents a discrete system event, each assigned an identifier like `TRAC-0001` and timestamped against a schema revision (`REVI-0003`, `REVI-0001`). Similarly, procedural records like `access review` or `compliance audit` are linked to related components—`validation suite`, `training cluster`, `ingestion pipeline`—forming a structured view of how processes interact with supporting infrastructure. These entities serve as the primary keys around which all attribute data and relational metadata are organized, ensuring that every measurement, status code, or host reference can be traced back to its originating event.

Attributes define the dimensions along which entities are measured and described, with each attribute carrying a formal type declaration that governs how its values are stored and validated. The attribute `duration_seconds` is typed as `xsd:decimal`, `end_time` as `xsd:dateTime`, `exit_code` as `xsd:integer`, and `host_name` as `xsd:string`. This type discipline is enforced through a value-dispatch architecture: decimal values such as `1505.64` or `5061.29` are persisted in a dedicated decimal store, datetime values like `2023-04-16T02:44:01` or `2024-07-31T11:49:14` in a datetime store, integer values such as `376` or `88` in an integer store, and string values like `node-b14`, `Log Level 02`, `initiation`, or `complete` in a varchar store. Each value record binds an entity identifier to an attribute identifier, creating a sparse but type-safe property model that accommodates entities with varying attribute profiles without requiring schema migrations.

Schema revisions provide the versioning backbone for the entire data model, recording when and against which legacy schema a given definition was produced. A revision identified as `REVI-0001` carries the schema label `network_flow_record` and is traced back to the `legacy_compliance_log` lineage, while `REVI-0004` references `clinical_trial_protocol` derived from `legacy_network_record`. The `observed_at` field on trace entities points directly to these revision identifiers, establishing a temporal provenance chain: every measurement is not only attributed to an entity but also anchored to the schema version that was in effect at the time of observation. This enables auditors to reconstruct the exact data dictionary that governed a given record's structure, a requirement for compliance frameworks that demand schema-level traceability.

The relationship between schema revisions is itself modeled as a first-class entity, with a junction table that captures directed links between revisions and assigns a role to each connection. A revision `REVI-0001` may link to `REVI-0006` in the role of `reviewer`, to `REVI-0001` as a `contributor`, or to `REVI-0003` as an `owner`, while revision `REVI-0007` assumes the `owner` role over `REVI-0003`. These role-qualified edges encode governance relationships—distinguishing who authored, reviewed, or owns a schema revision—and support audit trails that answer not just what changed but who was accountable for the change. In regulated domains, this role-aware provenance is essential for demonstrating separation of duties and maintaining an unbroken chain of custody over data definitions.

Across both trace and process domains, the same attribute-value pattern repeats: `duration_seconds` values for process records reach magnitudes like `6522.24` and `5070.41`, while integer exit codes such as `759` and `24` capture procedural outcomes, and varchar fields record host identifiers like `gw-12` and status strings like `review` or `failed`. The consistency of this structure across entity types means that governance policies, monitoring dashboards, and compliance reports can be built on a uniform query layer that operates over the attribute type rather than entity-specific columns. This abstraction is what allows an organization to add new entity types or attributes without rewriting the underlying data pipeline, while still maintaining the type safety and provenance guarantees that auditors require.
