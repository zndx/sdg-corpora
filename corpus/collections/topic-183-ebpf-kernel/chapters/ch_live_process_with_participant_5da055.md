The data model centers on a normalized attribute-value architecture where entities are described through a schema of named attributes whose types are declared independently of the values they hold. Each entity—whether a process execution with a participant or a professional expertise domain—is first registered with a stable identifier and a set of descriptive attributes. For process-participant records, attributes such as `duration_seconds`, `end_time`, `exit_code`, and `host_name` are defined with their corresponding XML Schema types: `xsd:decimal`, `xsd:dateTime`, `xsd:integer`, and `xsd:string`. Similarly, expertise domains carry attributes like `confidence`, `dimension_kind`, `method`, and `recorded_at`, each typed to enforce value constraints at the schema level. This separation of attribute metadata from actual values enables flexible, type-safe storage without requiring schema migrations when new attributes are introduced.

Values are materialized in dedicated type-specific tables, each keyed by a composite of the entity identifier and the attribute identifier. A process-participant record identified as `PART-0001` might have a `duration_seconds` value of `565.34` stored in the decimal value table, an `end_time` of `2024-06-12T21:46:50` in the datetime table, an `exit_code` of `231` in the integer table, and a `host_name` of `gw-12` in the varchar table. The same entity can carry multiple attributes of different types, and the value tables are joined on the entity and attribute identifiers to reconstruct the full attribute set. This design avoids the pitfalls of wide, sparse tables while preserving type discipline: a `confidence` score of `0.863` for a Cybersecurity Auditor domain is stored as a decimal, while its `dimension_kind` of `Dimension Kind 01` and `method` of `calibration record` reside in the varchar store.

Beyond the attribute-value machinery, the model captures professional experience as a first-class entity with its own set of contextual dimensions. Each experience record—such as Elena Rostova's tenure in the ML Platform Unit at Nexus Data Corp, or Fatima Al-Mansour's role within Quantum Provenance at Systems Reliability—carries an encoding specification (`latin1`, `utf8`, `ascii`) and a language designation (`fr`, `de`, `es`, `ja`). These fields anchor professional records to concrete technical and linguistic contexts, ensuring that multilingual or legacy-encoded data can be preserved and interpreted correctly. The holder field identifies the organizational unit or team (e.g., Quality Assurance, Governance Council), while the organization field names the employing entity, creating a clear chain of attribution from individual to institution.

Expertise domains extend this professional model by mapping individuals and their experience to industry sectors and service types. A Cybersecurity Auditor role may cover Manufacturing Operations and provide Regulatory Compliance services, while a Forensic Accountant operating in Public Infrastructure delivers Contract Drafting. The domain entity itself is enriched with typed attributes: a `confidence` value of `0.863` or `0.147` quantifies the assessed certainty of the domain classification, `recorded_at` timestamps such as `2024-07-30T07:07:17` or `2024-12-04T20:31:19` establish when the assessment was made, and categorical attributes like `dimension_kind` and `method` describe the evaluation framework. This structure supports auditability and traceability—every domain classification carries its own provenance metadata.

The foreign-key relationships between these tables form a coherent graph of process execution, professional identity, and domain expertise. Process-participant records link a process (e.g., `access review`, `network synchronization`, `compliance audit`) to a related system or service (e.g., `validation suite`, `scheduler service`, `training cluster`, `ingestion pipeline`), and their attribute values are resolved through the value tables using the entity and attribute identifiers defined in the attribute schema. Professional experience records reference holders and organizations, while expertise domains reference industry sectors and service types, creating cross-references that connect individual qualifications to organizational roles and industry contexts. The consistent use of typed identifiers—`PART-0001` through `PART-0004` for process participants, `EXPE-0001` through `EXPE-0004` for experience records, and `DOMA-0001` through `DOMA-0004` for expertise domains—ensures referential integrity across the entire model.
