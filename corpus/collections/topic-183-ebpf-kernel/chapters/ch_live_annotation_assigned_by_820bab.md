In distributed systems and data governance frameworks, every observable event or configuration artifact must be uniquely identifiable and richly annotated to support auditability, provenance tracking, and operational debugging. The system achieves this through a layered identification model where each record carries a stable identifier—such as `ASSI-0001` for an annotation assigned by the `policy_engine_v2`, `SPEC-0001` for a shell dimension specification describing `Venus_venerupis_Mediterranean`, or `TRAC-0001` for a trace span labeled `lambda-process-image`. These identifiers serve as the primary keys anchoring all downstream relationships, ensuring that every annotation, specification, or telemetry span can be referenced unambiguously across the system. The identifiers follow a consistent prefix-and-sequence convention that encodes the entity class at a glance, enabling operators to distinguish annotation records from dimension specifications and trace spans without inspecting the payload.

Annotations and dimension specifications are enriched through a flexible attribute-value model that decouples attribute definitions from their concrete values. Each entity type declares its supported attributes through a schema table listing an `attr_name`—such as `confidence`, `dimension_kind`, `method`, or `recorded_at`—alongside an `attr_type` drawn from the XSD type system, including `xsd:decimal`, `xsd:string`, and `xsd:dateTime`. The actual values are then stored in type-specific value tables, each keyed by a composite of a value identifier, an `entity_id` foreign key pointing back to the annotated record, and an `attr_id` foreign key referencing the attribute definition. This normalization means that a decimal attribute like `confidence` with a value of `0.167` or `103.53` lives in the decimal value table, while a string attribute such as `dimension_kind` holding `Dimension Kind 01` or `Encoding 02` resides in the varchar value table, and a timestamp like `recorded_at` with value `2025-05-21T21:38:03` is stored in the datetime value table. The same attribute name can appear across different entity types—both annotations and shell dimension specifications define `confidence`, `dimension_kind`, `method`, and `recorded_at`—allowing a uniform annotation vocabulary to be applied across heterogeneous data classes.

The trace subsystem extends this model to capture the hierarchical relationships between distributed spans. A span, identified by records such as `TRAC-0001` through `TRAC-0004` and labeled with operation names like `http-get-users`, `auth-validate-token`, or `lambda-process-image`, is associated with a broader context through a `part_of` relationship table. This junction table introduces three distinct columns: `span_id`, which acts as the **subject** of the relationship and references the originating span; `part_of_id`, which serves as the **target** and points to the parent span or trace context; and `role`, which qualifies the nature of the relationship with values such as `contributor` or `observer`. For instance, span `TRAC-0002` (labeled `http-get-users`) has a `part_of` value of `auth-flow` and participates in the relationship as an `observer` linking span `TRAC-0002` to parent `TRAC-0006`, while span `TRAC-0007` plays the role of `contributor` in its own relationship. This tripartite structure—subject, target, and role—enables the system to express not just that one span belongs to another, but in what capacity, supporting nuanced tracing and accountability in complex request flows such as `data-ingest-job`, `checkout-session`, or `api-request`.
