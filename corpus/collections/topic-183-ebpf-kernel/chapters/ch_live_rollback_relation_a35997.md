The data model employs an entity-attribute-value architecture to represent heterogeneous business objects through a unified, extensible structure. Each entity—whether a rollback relation, a professional expertise domain, or a schema version subclass—is assigned a unique identifier such as RELA-0001, DOMA-0001, or VERS-0001. These identifiers serve as the primary key anchoring every record and enable cross-referencing across the attribute and value layers. The entity tables themselves capture the core business semantics: rollback relations link a rollback action like release-tag-v3.2 to its target batch-processing-halt; professional expertise domains encode the intersection of a role such as Cybersecurity Auditor with the industry sector it covers, like Manufacturing Operations, and the service type it provides, such as Asset Valuation; schema version subclasses associate a schema name like EventCatalog with its version tag release-11.0.

Attributes are defined separately from entities and values, establishing a schema-level catalog of properties that can be applied across entity types. Each attribute carries a name and a type drawn from a typed vocabulary: xsd:decimal for numeric measures, xsd:string for categorical labels, xsd:dateTime for temporal stamps, xsd:date for calendar dates, and cco:DesignativeICE for designative identifiers. For instance, the professional expertise domain attributes include confidence (xsd:decimal), dimension_kind (xsd:string), method (xsd:string), and recorded_at (xsd:dateTime), while the schema version subclass attributes encompass checksum (xsd:string), created_date (xsd:date), identifier (cco:DesignativeICE), and license (xsd:string). This decoupling of attribute definitions from their values allows new properties to be introduced without altering the entity or value tables.

Values are materialized in type-specific tables that reference both the entity and the attribute through foreign keys, ensuring that each stored value is semantically grounded. The decimal value table holds quantitative measurements such as 0.863 and 0.023 for confidence scores, alongside magnitudes like 717.59 and 628.37 for dimension-level metrics. The varchar value table stores free-form and coded strings including Dimension Kind 01, Encoding 02, calibration record, and de, while the datetime and date tables capture temporal metadata such as 2024-05-22T12:01:29 and 2024-06-07. This type-partitioned storage strategy preserves data integrity at query time by constraining each value table to a single schema, while the entity_id and attr_id columns provide the relational glue that reconstructs the full attribute-value pair for any given entity.

The professional expertise domain entities illustrate how the model encodes the triad of professional role, industry sector, and service type within a single record. A Cybersecurity Auditor may cover Manufacturing Operations and provide Asset Valuation services, while another instance of the same role might address Commercial Real Estate and deliver Regulatory Compliance. A Forensic Accountant operates within Public Infrastructure and performs Contract Drafting, and a Clinical Psychologist similarly serves Public Infrastructure but provides Asset Valuation. These combinations are not hard-coded into the schema; rather, the domain columns capture the business semantics, and the attribute-value layer enriches each record with operational metadata—confidence scores ranging from 0.147 to 0.863, dimension kinds, encoding schemes, and timestamps such as 2024-07-30T07:07:17—that support auditability and governance workflows.

The same architectural pattern extends to schema version management, where the schema_version_subclass table records the relationship between a schema name and its version identifier, and the attribute-value tables capture provenance details. A schema version of EventCatalog at release-11.0 carries a checksum value of a3f9c21e, a license of doi:10.1109/x, an identifier of MPL-2.0, and a deployment target of on-prem-dc1, with a creation date of 2024-06-07 and integer counters of 24 and 11. Similarly, an AccessControlMatrix schema at rc-2.1 is associated with a creation date of 2024-09-26 and counters of 16 and 12. The rollback relation entities follow an identical pattern, with attributes capturing method, dimension_kind, confidence, and recorded_at timestamps such as 2025-05-09T21:44:43, enabling traceability across the full lifecycle of system changes.

This entity-attribute-value design achieves two complementary objectives. First, it provides a uniform interface for querying and governing heterogeneous data types—numeric, textual, temporal—without requiring schema migrations when new attributes are introduced. Second, it preserves the relational integrity of the data through explicit foreign-key links between identifiers, attributes, and typed values, ensuring that every stored datum can be traced back to its entity and its semantic definition. The model supports compliance and operational workflows by making it straightforward to audit which attributes were recorded when, what values they held, and how those values relate to the broader business context encoded in the entity tables.
