The agricultural household, parasitic weed, and rice cultivation system entities form a relational model for tracking how crop parasitism propagates through farming ecosystems and affects human stakeholders. At the center of this model, the crop parasitism impact table anchors the domain with records such as IMPA-0001 through IMPA-0004, each carrying a descriptive label like Crop Parasitism Impact 01. These impact records do not exist in isolation; they connect outward through a series of junction tables that encode directed, role-labeled relationships. An impact may affect a cultivation system—for instance, IMPA-0001 and IMPA-0002 both reference IMPA-0006 as the affected rice cultivation system, while IMPA-0002 additionally links to IMPA-0002—each association carrying a role qualifier such as owner that specifies the nature of the relationship. Similarly, parasitism impacts are linked to parasitic weed hosts through a separate junction table where the cardinality note column (Cardinality Note 01 through 04) constrains the multiplicity of the parasitism relationship, and the role column distinguishes between contributor and observer designations, as seen when IMPA-0004 and IMPA-0002 assume contributor roles while IMPA-0006 and IMPA-0001 are recorded as observers.

The downstream effects of these biological relationships on human populations are captured through the agricultural household impact linkage, which introduces temporal precision via the since column. Records in this junction table carry since dates ranging from 2023-03-28 to 2024-06-04, establishing a chronological provenance for when each impact began affecting a given household. The role column here takes on values such as observer, reviewer, and owner, allowing the system to distinguish between stakeholders who monitor the impact, those who validate its assessment, and those directly responsible for managing it. For example, IMPA-0003 links to agricultural household IMPA-0002 with an owner role since 2023-10-26, while IMPA-0006 links to the same household as a reviewer since 2023-03-28, illustrating how multiple impacts and multiple stakeholder roles can converge on a single household entity.

Beyond the agricultural domain, the schema extends into a requirement satisfaction framework that mirrors the same relational pattern of subject-target-role associations. The requirement table holds specifications such as OWASP authentication flow and IEEE 802.1Q tagging, while the satisfaction table records mechanisms like Let's Encrypt, OpenSSL 3.0, and FIPS 140-3 modules. The junction table connecting them uses the same role vocabulary—reviewer and observer—to classify how each satisfaction mechanism relates to its requirement, demonstrating that the role-based relationship model is a reusable architectural pattern rather than a domain-specific construct.

The distribution profile subsystem provides a flexible attribute-value layer that operates orthogonally to the relationship tables. Profiles such as Schema Evolution Registry and Anomaly Detection Ruleset are associated with distributions like Kafka Topic Stream and JSON Schema Registry, and their attributes are defined in a separate table with columns for attr_name and attr_type, specifying both the semantic identifier and the XML Schema datatype—xsd:decimal for confidence scores, xsd:string for dimension_kind and method, and xsd:dateTime for recorded_at timestamps. The actual values are stored in type-specialized tables: decimal values such as 0.522 and 445.38 in the decimal store, datetime values like 2024-02-01T19:38:09 in the datetime store, and string values including Dimension Kind 01 and nightly summary in the varchar store. This EAV (entity-attribute-value) decomposition by type ensures that the schema can accommodate heterogeneous metadata without sacrificing type safety, while the entity_id column in each value table ties the attribute back to its originating distribution record.
