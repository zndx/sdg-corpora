Shell dimension specifications and process subclass mappings constitute two distinct entity families, each anchored by a unique identifier—SPEC-0001 through SPEC-0004 for shell dimension specifications, PROC-0001 through PROC-0004 for process subclasses, and ARTI-0001 through ARTI-0005 for verification artifacts. The shell dimension specification entities carry domain labels such as Venus_venerupis_Mediterranean, Cypraea_tigris_Asian, Littorina_obtusa_Urban, and Strombus_gigas_Tropical, while the process entities are classified as incident response, data validation, telemetry aggregation, and batch ingestion. These identifiers serve as the primary keys for their respective entity tables and, critically, as foreign keys in the attribute-value and relationship tables that follow.

Attributes are defined independently of their values through attribute definition tables that pair an attr_name with an attr_type. For shell dimension specifications, the defined attributes include confidence, dimension_kind, method, and recorded_at, each typed as xsd:decimal, xsd:string, xsd:string, and xsd:dateTime respectively. The process subclass attributes—duration_seconds, end_time, exit_code, and host_name—follow the same pattern, with types xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:integer, and xsd:string. This separation of attribute schema from data enables type-safe storage without requiring schema migrations when new attributes are introduced.

Attribute values are materialized in type-dispatched value tables, each column named value but carrying the semantic role of misc—the miscellaneous data payload for a given entity-attribute pair. Decimal attributes such as confidence and duration_seconds resolve to values like 0.130, 733.39, 125.34, 0.624, 5106.96, 6532.76, 6219.83, and 2715.88 across the entity_id and attr_id foreign keys. String attributes capture dimension_kind values such as Dimension Kind 01, Encoding 02, nightly summary, and ja, alongside host_name entries like worker-07 and log-level descriptors such as Log Level 02, closeout, and pending. Datetime attributes record timestamps including 2024-08-09T04:20:11, 2023-01-11T02:33:00, 2025-04-11T22:51:28, 2025-04-30T10:31:45, 2024-02-25T00:58:35, 2025-01-11T16:52:13, 2024-01-24T01:55:59, and 2024-06-21T23:54:50. Integer attributes hold exit codes such as 684, 195, 63, and 361. The entity_id column in each value table points back to the originating entity, while attr_id references the attribute definition, forming a normalized entity-attribute-value triad that preserves type integrity through table partitioning.

The verification subsystem introduces a relational model centered on subject and target roles within artifact-to-artifact linkages. The junction table t_verification_targets_artifact__targets_artifact binds a verification_id—designated as the subject—to a targets_artifact_id—designated as the target—through an explicit role column that classifies the relationship as reviewer, owner, or contributor. For instance, verification ARTI-0002 assumes the reviewer role against target ARTI-0002, while ARTI-0004 serves as owner of ARTI-0003; ARTI-0005 appears twice, acting as reviewer of ARTI-0001 and contributor of ARTI-0001. The verification artifacts themselves carry descriptive labels—Compliance review cycle and Data lineage audit—while the target artifacts include Sensor calibration matrix and Source code branch. This subject-target-role triad enables fine-grained provenance tracking, where the same artifact can participate in multiple verification relationships under different capacities without ambiguity.
