Within the verification subsystem, each assessment—whether a Compliance renewal verification, a GDPR data flow review, or a Security posture assessment—is assigned a unique identifier such as VERI-0001 through VERI-0004, establishing a stable reference point across all downstream measurements. Attributes of these verifications are themselves identified and typed: duration_seconds carries the type xsd:decimal, end_time is xsd:dateTime, exit_code is xsd:integer, and host_name is xsd:string. The type discipline governs which value store receives a given measurement; decimal-valued observations such as 5469.69, 821.61, 4016.93, and 4484.04 are persisted in the decimal value table, integer-valued observations including 616, 105, 713, and 29 in the integer table, and string-valued observations like node-a01, Log Level 02, review, and running in the varchar table. Temporal attributes receive their own dedicated store, holding timestamps such as 2024-10-23T14:58:17 and 2024-02-27T03:56:28. The entity_id column in each value table binds a measurement to the verification it describes, while attr_id resolves to the attribute definition, forming a triadic link between identifier, attribute, and value that preserves type integrity across heterogeneous data stores.

The temporal dimension of analytical observations is captured through a pair of dimension tables that separate categorical classification from labeling. The category dimension assigns each time window a category identifier—WIND-0008 or WIND-0004 in the observed data—while the time window dimension itself carries a human-readable label such as Over Time Window Label 01 and a category descriptor like Over Time Window Category 01. These two dimensions are linked by category_id, ensuring that every time window can be classified without duplicating category metadata. The fact table then anchors individual observations to a specific time window via over_time_window_key, producing a star-schema arrangement in which the fact row carries the measured value—728.94, 380.57, 607.36, or 448.09—alongside two companion columns: confidence, a probability-like measure ranging from 0.226 to 0.994, and uncertainty, a scalar magnitude ranging from 284.36 to 622.09. The confidence column quantifies the analyst's degree of belief in the observation, while the uncertainty column quantifies the residual ignorance or dispersion; together they provide a complete evidential profile for each fact, enabling downstream reasoning that distinguishes between low-confidence-high-uncertainty readings and high-confidence-low-uncertainty readings.

The Dempster-Shafer combination framework introduces a second layer of relational structure, where sources of evidence are classified by their combiner type and their provenance. Combiner types include UncertaintyPropagationPipeline, MultiSourceInferenceEngine, EvidenceCombinationModel, and ProvenanceAggregator, each identified by a code such as FIRS-0001 through FIRS-0004. The sources themselves—HistoricalLogArchive, CoreTelemetryFeed, GroundTruthLabels, and PrimaryFlightData—are stored in a separate table and linked to combinators through a junction table that records, for each pairing, a role: observer, reviewer, or owner. The junction table carries two foreign keys, dempster_id pointing to the combiner and first_combinant_id pointing to the source, thereby encoding a directed relationship in which a combiner aggregates evidence from a source under a specified role. This tripartite structure—subject (the combiner), target (the source), and role (the function the source serves)—allows the system to track not only which evidence feeds which reasoning pipeline but also the epistemic posture from which that evidence is contributed, a distinction that becomes critical when combining conflicting or overlapping belief assignments.
